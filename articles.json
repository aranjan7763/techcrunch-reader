      "content": "Lucid Motors is laying off 12% of its workforce in a bid to “improve operational effectiveness and optimize our resources as we continue on our path toward profitability,” according to an internal memo that was obtained by TechCrunch.\n\nHourly workers on the manufacturing, logistics, and quality teams are not affected by the cuts, according to the memo, which was sent to employees being spared by the layoffs. It’s unclear exactly how many workers are being laid off, but it is likely in the hundreds. Lucid Motors reported having 6,800 full-time employees globallyat the end of 2024.\n\n“Saying goodbye to colleagues is never easy,” interim CEO Marc Winterhoff wrote in the memo. “We are grateful for the contributions of those impacted by today’s actions, and we are providing severance, bonus, continued health benefits, and transition support to help them through this period.” The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe cuts come as the company is in the middle of ramping up production and deliveries of its Gravity SUV. While Lucid Motors struggled with Gravity production and quality issues during the first few months, the company has been able to pick up the pace, and ultimatelydoubled its 2024 outputlast year.\n\nThe company is also preparing to launch a more affordable mid-size EV later this year that is expected to cost around $50,000. It’s collaborating with Uber and autonomous vehicle company Nuro on launching a robotaxi service in the San Francisco area this year, too. The company is scheduled to release its financial results for 2025 next week.\n\n“Importantly, today’s actions do not affect our strategy,” Winterhoff wrote in the memo. “Our core priorities remain unchanged, and we continue to focus on the start of production of our Midsize platform. With disciplined execution, we are also focused on further expansion into the robotaxi market, continued ADAS and software development, and growth in sales of Lucid Gravity and Air across existing and new geographies.”\n\nLucid Motors has now gone almost a full year without a permanent CEO. Peter Rawlinson, who was the company’s chief executive and chief technical officer,abruptly resignedon February 25, 2025. Since then, Lucid Motors has seen asignificant amount of turnover in its executive ranks, including the loss of its chief engineer, whosued the companyin December for wrongful termination and discrimination. (Lucid Motors has called his legal claims “absurd.”)",

      "content": "It’s no secret that the electrical grid is aging, but one part stands out from the rest. Transformers haven’t changed much since Thomas Edison made his first light bulb.\n\nNow, a string of startups are working to modernize the transformer, replacing it with modern power electronics that promise to give grid operators more control over how and where electricity flows.\n\n“It becomes a very powerful device, equivalent to your internet router,” Subhashish Bhattacharya, co-founder and CTO ofDG Matrix, told TechCrunch.\n\nThree startups recently raised sizable rounds to scale up production of their solid-state transformer technologies. This week, DG Matrix raised a$60 million Series Aand Heron Power raised$140 million in a Series Bround. In November, Amperesand raised $80 million tochase afterthe burgeoning data center market.\n\nExisting transformers are reliable and efficient, but that’s about it. They’re relatively crude instruments, made largely of copper and iron. They react passively to changes on the grid and are capable of tackling only one task per device.\n\n“An old-school steel, copper, and oil transformer doesn’t have any monitoring, doesn’t have any control,” Drew Baglino, founder and CEO ofHeron Power, told TechCrunch. In instances where electricity surges or a power plant trips offline, that can be a liability.\n\nThe devices can incorporate power from a range of difference sources — including traditional power plants, renewables, and batteries — and transform that electricity into either alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC) at a number of different voltages, allowing them to replace several devices.\n\nFor data centers, solid-state transformers offer an appealing alternative, allowing them to shrink the footprint of their power systems while giving them finer control over where and how electricity is directed.\n\nSolid-state transformers poised to arrive at a time when existing transformers are aging and demand for new ones is surging — a classic tech supercycle. Most transformers on the grid today are several decades old,accordingto the National Laboratory of the Rockies. As demand from data centers, EV chargers, and other parts of the grid rises, the NLR expects the amount of power flowing through transformers to double by 2050.\n\nWhile data centers are the the first market those companies are chasing, they also have their sights set on the electrical grid, which in the U.S. alone hostsas many as 80 million transformers.\n\n“All of the distribution transformers are ultimately going to need to be replaced. Over 50% of them are 35 years old. There’s a big need for an upgrade,” Baglino said.\n\nBecause they’re are made from silicon-based materials, they’re flexible, controllable, and software-updatable. They’re also immune from price fluctuations that rock the copper market.\n\n“Power semiconductors keep getting cheaper. Steel, copper, and oil, unfortunately, is not in that situation,” Baglino said. “Commodity prices can move all over the place, and they generally move up.”\n\nIn an old-style transformer, power flows into the transformer through copper wires wound around one side of an O-shaped iron core. As the electricity flows, it induces a magnetic field in the core. On the other side of the core, the magnetic field induces electricity in another set of copper windings. If the wires wrap around the core more times on the input side than the output side, the voltage decreases on the output side. If the ratio inverts, the output voltage increases.\n\nSolid-state transformers eschew the copper windings in favor of semiconductors, using materials like silicon carbide or gallium nitride to handle frequency conversion. They can come in a range of configurations, with the most comprehensive setup consisting of three basic parts: a rectifier that converts alternating current to direct current, a converter that changes the voltage of the direct current, and an inverter that changes the direct current back into alternating current.\n\nUnlike iron-core transformers, solid-state transformers can handle power that flows in both directions, making them useful in places that need backup power, like data centers.\n\nIn a data center, a solid-state transformer can replace several different pieces of equipment, not just the transformer that steps voltage down from the grid. Every data center uses backup power, which requires a string of devices to bring power into the facility. Solid-state transformers can handle all of those duties in one box.\n\nThe technology also allows data centers to more easily integrate so-called behind-the-meter power, where generating capacity is connected directly to the data center, not the grid. Those typically require another set of transformers.\n\nAnd when coupled with grid-scale batteries, solid-state transformers can eliminate uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), too, freeing up space inside the data center for more racks.\n\n“If you add up the cost of everything we’ve taken out, we’re 60% to 70% of that cost,” Haroon Inam, co-founder and CEO of DG Matrix, told TechCrunch.\n\nDG Matrix has been focusing on its Interport technology, which can route power from multiple sources to multiple loads of differing voltages, a setup the company holds multiple patents on.\n\nHeron Power, meanwhile, is working to transforming medium-voltage power in data centers, solar farms, and grid-scale battery installations. In a data center, it’s Heron Link transformers can provide racks with 30 seconds of power while backup sources come online. Altogether, Heron Link occupy 70% less space than existing parts. At a solar farm, Heron Power’s transformers can perform the duties of an inverter and a transformer for the same price.\n\nIn a head-to-head comparison, solid state transformers still command a cost premium over iron-core transformers. For that reason, they’re unlikely to replace the giant humming boxes at grid substations in the very near future.\n\nBut in data centers and at EV charging hubs, where solid-state transformers take the place of several pieces of equipment, they’ll start making inroads.\n\nWhen they finally hit the grid in bigger numbers, they have the potential to cut down on transmission and distribution costs, one of the biggest contributors to utility bill inflation.\n\nBecause today’s transformers are passive, unable to react to fluctuations, distribution networks have been built with a significant amount of spare capacity, Baglino said. Solid-state transformers, though, and can respond to changing conditions, allowing grid operators to send more power through the same lines.\n\n“You can actually make the infrastructure more affordable because you’re putting more kilowatt-hours through the same poles and wires,” he said. “That’s where intelligence, in place of passive mechanical objects that were designed 100 years ago, can make a big difference.”",

The tech giant said it’s shifting focus for Horizon Worlds to be “almost exclusively mobile” and that it’s “explicitly separating” its Quest VR platform from the virtual world.\n\nMeta’s Reality Labs division for VR and smart glasses development has lostnearly $80 billionsince 2020. The update to Horizon Worlds, and other recent moves, signals that Meta is significantly rethinking its VR ambitions.\n\nLast month, the company reportedly laid offroughly 1,500 employeesfrom its Reality Labs division — about 10% of the unit’s staff — andshut downseveral VR game studios. Additionally, it was reported that the VR fitness app Supernatural, whichMeta acquiredin 2023, will no longer produce new content and will move into “maintenance mode.”\n\nHorizon Worlds originally launched in 2021 as a VR platform and laterrolled outto the web and mobile. Meta said Thursday that to “truly change the game and tap into a much larger market, we’re going all-in on mobile.”\n\nBy going mobile-first, Horizon Worlds is positioning itself to compete with popular platforms like Roblox and Fortnite.\n\n“We’re in a strong position to deliver synchronous social games at scale, thanks to our unique ability to connect those games with billions of people on the world’s biggest social networks,” Samantha Ryan, Reality Labs’ VP of content, said in the blog post. “You saw this strategy start to unfold in 2025, and now, it’s our main focus.”\n\nRyan went on to note that Meta is still focused on VR hardware.\n\n“We have a robust roadmap of future VR headsets that will be tailored to different audience segments as the market grows and matures,” Ryan wrote.\n\nMeta’s metaverse ambitions have effectively been abandoned in favor of AI. After shifting its Reality Labs investmentsaway from the metaverse, Meta is now focused on developing AI wearables and advancing its ownAI models.\n\nDuring Meta’s latest earnings call last month, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerbergsaid, “It’s hard to imagine a world in several years where most glasses that people wear aren’t AI glasses.”\n\nThe exec also stated that sales of Meta’s glasses tripled within the last year, calling them “some of the fastest-growing consumer electronics in history.”",

The company said on Friday that users between 18 and 24 years of age accounted for nearly 50% of messages sent to ChatGPT in the country, and users under 30 accounted for 80%.\n\nThe AI lab said Indians use ChatGPT mostly for work, with 35% of all messages relating to professional tasks, compared to 30% globally.\n\nIn particular, the company’s coding assistant, Codex, is seeing strong traction: OpenAI said Indians use Codex three times more than the global median, and weekly usage has increased by four times since the toolgot a Mac apptwo weeks ago. Users in India are also asking three times as many coding-related questions as the median.\n\nThis is in line with findings from Antropic, which earlier this week said45.2% of Claude’s tasks map to software-related use casesin India.\n\nOpenAI said outside of work tasks, 35% of messages to ChatGPT from Indians requested guidance, 20% concerned questions about general information, and 20% were requests for the bot to produce or help with writing.\n\nIndia is OpenAI’s second-largest market with more than 100 million weekly users, and the company has been actively trying to court Indians for its AI tools and services.

      "content": "For the most sought-after founders, the prestige of a top-tier accelerator is increasingly weighed against giving up a significant ownership stake in their company.\n\nAli Partovi, the veteran investor and CEO ofventure firm Neo, wants to offer the mentorship and community of one of the most elite accelerator programs—without forcing the best up-and-coming tech leaders to hand over7%or even10%of their company before they’ve even started.\n\nPartovi, who is known for his early investments in Facebook, Cursor, and Kalshi, has just introducedNeo Residency, a new, competitively structured program that combines the firm’s now four-year-old accelerator with a track for current college students.\n\nThe terms that Neo Residency offers are so founder-friendly as to be “not even comparable to any other accelerator,” Partovi told TechCrunch.\n\nFor the cohort of 12 to 15 startups entering the program this summer, Neo will invest $750,000 via an uncapped SAFE — a contract that gives an investor future equity in exchange for money now, with no ceiling on the valuation used to calculate that stake. Unlike the fixed-percentage deals typical of other accelerators, Neo won’t receive its equity until the company’s next formal funding round, and even then, the dilution is tied to valuation. If a startup raises its next round at a $15 million valuation, Neo’s stake will be 5%, but if that valuation hits $100 million, the firm’s ownership drops to just 0.75%.\n\n“We take the risk up front, so this is extremely favorable to startups,” Partovi said.\n\nIn comparison, Y Combinatortypically takes a fixed 7%of the company for $125,000, with another $375,000 invested on an uncapped MFN — or most-favored nation — SAFE, a clause that ensures early investors get terms at least as good as those given to later ones. Meanwhile, Andreessen Horowitz’s Speedrun program typically invests $500,000 in exchange for 10% of the startup via a SAFE note, and another $500,000 if the next round is raised within 18 months at whatever terms are agreed to by the other investors.\n\n“We’re offering a deal so great that it’s appropriate even for founders who are not even considering any other accelerator,” Partovi said.\n\nThe lower equity cost is only part of Neo Residency’s appeal.\n\nThe founders will work for three months at Neo’s offices in San Francisco’s Jackson Square district, participate in a two-week bootcamp in the Oregon mountains, and be mentored by about 30 experienced operators, including Russell Kaplan, president of Cognition, and Fuzzy Khosrowshahi, CTO of Notion (and the creator ofGoogle Sheetsand also Partovi’s uncle).\n\nBut the program’s main draw is its prestige: Seed and Series A investors generally have great respect for founders handpicked by Partovi.\n\n“The one [accelerator] I like right now that has very high signal, and every founder I met there is just wicked smart, is Neo,” Wesley Chan, co-founder and managing partner of FPV Ventures,said on stage at 2025 TechCrunch Disrupt.\n\nStartups that have gone through the program include Moment, a fintech company that has raised$56 millionfrom investors like Andreessen Horowitz, and Anterior, a healthcare AI startup backed by NEA and Sequoia.\n\nThe Neo Residency will also select five to eight students—either as individuals or small teams—who will receive a $40,000, no-strings-attached grant to take a semester off to work on a project. While there is no requirement to drop out or start a formal company immediately, Partovi said he hopes the students will catch the entrepreneurial bug and, when they eventually launch a startup, turn to Neo for funding.\n\nNeo is keeping the program small and elite: it will cap its two annual cohorts at 20 teams each, consisting of a mix of active startups and student projects.\n\nWhy is Neo offering such generous terms? “We have more confidence in our ability to attract and pick out future superstars than ever before,” Partovi said.\n\nHis track record suggests that confidence is well-founded. He famously met Cursor co-founder Michael Truell while Truell was still an MIT student and later wrote one of the first checks into the AI coding startup, now valued at nearly$30 billion.",

Notably, the jury assessed punitive damages only against Tesla.\n\nTesla’s lawyers argued, in its request to reverse the ruling, that the blame rested on the driver, who helped cause the crash.",

With the launch of a new Threads feature this week, the company is making it easier for Threads users to share posts on the app to their Instagram Stories — a move that could capitalize on Instagram’s larger user base to bring more people to Meta’s X competitor.\n\nThe companyannouncedon Thursday a new feature that lets you share a Threads post to your Instagram Story without having to leave the Threads app, instead previewing how the post would look on your Story directly within the Threads app.\n\nThe app previously allowed you to share anyone’s Threads post to your Instagram Story similar to how you would reshare someone’s Instagram post to your Story. It also already offered tools for sharing posts to your Instagram Feed or DMs.\n\nMeta’s text-first, Twitter-like app Threads firstlaunched in July 2023and benefited from its ties with Instagram to rapidly grow its initial user base. To sign up, users had to authenticate with their Instagram credentials, which allowed Threads to populate with account details, like username, bio, and photo, as well as verification status and followers.\n\nWith one tap, users could immediately follow the accounts they already followed on Instagram — and those not on Threads would get a notification that someone had added them.\n\nIn the months and years following its launch, Meta has heavily leaned on its other, bigger social platforms to continue to grow Threads, including bydisplaying popular Threads posts on Facebookand adding a similar carousel ofThreads posts to Instagram users. The company also made it easy for users tocross-post from Instagram and Facebook to Threads, which also helped boost adoption.\n\nThese moves have paid off. Data from market intelligence provider Similarweb last month indicated thatThreads is now seeing more daily usagethan Elon Musk’s X on mobile devices. (X still dominates on the web, however.) Threads’ numbers overall have been steadily growing as well, doubling usage from200 million monthly active users in August 2024to400 million monthly usersas of August 2025. The company announcedin Octoberthat Threads reached 150 million daily active users, as well.",

No one could have predicted that over thirty years later, Pixar would still be making Toy Story movies, nor could anyone have known that the latest installation in the franchise would pit Buzz Lightyear and a balding Woody against an evil AI tablet called Lilypad.\n\nBut sure enough,Toy Story 5confronts old-school toys like Mrs. Potato Head, Rex, and Slinky Dog against the sinister threat oftechnology.\n\nThe trailer shows Bonnie, the young girl who inherited Andy’s toys when he left for college inToy Story 2, playing outside with her toys when a surprise package with the Lilypad tablet arrives for her. She becomes completely enraptured by the tablet, not even looking up from the screen when her parents tell her that screen time is over.\n\nTheToy Story 5trailer makes the Lilypad — or, Lily — out to be a sinister villain. When Jessie confronts the tablet about Bonnie’s wellbeing, Lily seems not to be paying attention, so the cowgirl demands that the tablet listen to her.\n\n“I’m always listening,” Lily says ominously, regurgitating Jessie’s impassioned speech in a computerized tone… and then translates it into Spanish.\n\n“Tech’s invaded our house,” Jessie tells Woody. “I’m losing Bonnie to this device.”\n\nWoody replies, “Toys are for play, but tech is for everything.”\n\nCouldToy Story 5pull at the heartstrings of young children and get them to think twice about the consequences of excessive screen time? That may be a stretch. But at least it gives them something to watch that’s not as mind numbing as Cocomelon.",
