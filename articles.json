So proud of what the xAI team has done and will continue to stay close as a friend of the team,” itread in part.\n\nOn their own, both were pretty standard tech departure announcements — but they’re part of a troubling pattern for the lab. Six members ofthe company’s 12-person founding teamhave now left the company, with five of the departures coming in just the last year. Infrastructure lead Kyle Kosic left for OpenAI in mid-2024, followed by Google veteran Christian Szegedy in February 2025. This past August, Igor Babuschkinleft to found a venture firm, and Microsoft alum Greg Yang departed just last month,citing health issues.\n\nBy all accounts, the splits have all been amicable, and there are lots of reasons why, nearly three years in, some founders might decide to move on. Elon Musk is a notoriously demanding boss, and with the SpaceX’s acquisition of xAI complete and an IPO pending in the coming months, everyone involved has a pretty big windfall coming. It’s a great time to be fundraising for an AI startup, so it’s only natural for high-level researchers to want to strike out on their own.\n\nThere are also less amicable reasons that might factor in. The company’s flagship product, the Grok chatbot, has struggled withbizarre behaviorandapparent internal tampering— the kind of thing that might easily create friction on the technical team. Then there were the recent changes to xAI’s image-generation tools thatflooded the platform with deepfake po",

But the sibling duo used AI music in their rhythm dance program, which doesn’t break any official rules, but serves as a depressing symbol of how absolutely cooked we are.\n\nAs Mrázek spun his sister in a crazy cartwheel-lift-sort-of-move that made them look superhuman, one of the NBC commentators mentioned in passing, “This is AI generated, this first part,” referring to the music. Somehow, that admission is even more baffling than the gravity-defying tricks that the siblings showed off on the pressure of Olympic ice.\n\nThe Olympic ice dance competition is split into two events: the rhythm dance, where pairs must perform a routine that meets a specific theme, and the free dance. This season’s theme is “The Music, Dance Styles, and Feeling of the 1990s.” British ice dancing duo Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson paid tribute to the Spice Girls, while United States favorites Madison Chock and Evan Bates skated to a Lenny Kravitz medley.\n\nBut, for whatever reason — licensing issues? — Mrázková and Mrázek danced to a routine with music that’s half AC/DC and half AI. It’s weird. What’s even weirder is that this isn’t the duo’s first use of AI, nor is it the first time that this choice backfired.\n\nPer the International Skating Union, the governing body that oversees competitive ice skating, theduo’s music choicefor the rhythm dance this season has been “One Two by AI (of 90s style Bon Jovi)” and “Thunderstruck by AC/DC.” The official Olympics websiteconfirmsthat the duo is using the AI-generated song for the rhythm dance portion.\n\nok I know this is an art account but I have been seething about this ever since Shana Bartel caught it and wrote about it in her blog (which you should be reading it’s very good – link below) and I just NEEDED to get it out of me.  https://www.patreon.com/posts/142706982?utm_campaign=postshare_f",

Rivian is one of the companies that reportedly decided to change this on its upcoming R2 SUV, and aspateof first-look videos released Tuesday finally give us a look at what the company has changed.\n\nFirst off, the front doors open from the inside in thesame way as in the existing R1 vehicles. There is an electronic button that opens the door, and there’s a manual door-release latch tucked into the front part of the interior handle.\n\nThe rear doors also have an electronic button, as well as a change to the rear manual release.\n\nOn R1 vehicles, passengers have to first pull a panel off the door to access a “release cord” that operates the manual latch. On the new R2 SUV, Rivian moved this release cord to that same front-of-the-handle position as the front seat manual releases — though it’s still tucked behind a piece of plastic that must be popped out, making it slightly harder to access than the front door manual releases.\n\nThe R2 SUV isn’t set to go into production for another few months, so the company has not put out proper instructions on how to access this release. But here’s an image from a newvideopublished by JerryRigEverything’s Zack Nelson:\n\nHe doesn’t pull out the actual cord, but it’s the best illustration I’ve seen so far of what passengers will need to do if they are in an R2 that has lost power for whatever reason, limiting the vehicle’s electronic door release.\n\nThe manual release is still behind a piece of plastic, and it’s not the most obvious or accessible way to open a door from the inside. But it’s at least in a more logical spot than just being hidden behind a panel.\n\nThese kinds of situations don’t happen often. But when they do, it’s typically during a major crash. That means every moment can mean the difference between life and death.\n\nRivian ",

Now, as tech companies look for legally safe sources of AI training data, Amazon is reportedly considering launching a marketplace where publishers can license their content directly to AI companies.\n\nThe InformationreportedMonday that the e-commerce giant has been meeting with publishing executives and alerting them to its plans to launch such a marketplace. Ahead of an AWS conference for publishers that occurred Tuesday, Amazon “circulated slides that mention a content marketplace,” wrote the outlet.\n\nReached by TechCrunch, an Amazon spokesperson didn’t deny the story but didn’t directly address the would-be marketplace either, saying only: “Amazon has built long-lasting, innovative relationships with publishers across many areas of our business, including AWS, Retail, Advertising, AGI, and Alexa. We are always innovating together to best serve our customers, but we have nothing specific to share on this subject at this time.”\n\nAmazon wouldn’t be the first major tech company to take this route. Microsoft recentlylaunchedwhat it calls a Publisher Content Marketplace (PCM), which it says will give publishers “a new revenue stream” while also providing AI systems with “scaled access to premium content.” Microsoft added that the PCM was designed to “empower publishers with a transparent economic framework for licensing” their content.\n\nThe move is a natural next step for the AI industry, which has already sought to solve the legally nebulous problem of how copyrighted material ends up in AI training data by forging deals with major news outlets and media organizations. OpenAI, for instance, has already signedcontent-licensing partnershipswith the Associated Press, Vox Media, News Corp, and The Atlantic, among others.\n\nThose efforts haven’t been enough to stem the legal fallout.

The firm has since grown substantially — as Buchertold TechCrunch, it closed its most recent fund, a $150 million third vehicle, in 2024, bringing its assets under management to $450 million.\n\nSome of the most salacious details from the emails involve Epstein giving her money and a Prada bag, and on one occasion, asking her for nude photos — though there’s no indication whether she complied — according toSFGate.

And the two-year-old firm just raised a $120 million Series B round to scale that vision, TechCrunch has exclusively learned.\n\nLed by Accel with participation from Cyberstarts, Redpoint, and CRV, the new round nearly doubles Vega’s valuation to $700 million, and brings its total funding to $185 million, money the startup will use to further develop its AI-native security operations suite, beef up its go-to-market team, and expand globally.\n\nShay Sandler, co-founder and CEO of Vega, told TechCrunch that the current operating model of the SIEM (security information and event management) — the dominant technology in this domain for the last two decades — is not only “crazy expensive,” but is also increasingly causing AI-native security operations to fail. In complex cloud environments, he says, the current model often increases exposure to threat actors.\n\n“Vega has defined a new operating model that enables organizations to leverage the full potential of their enterprise data to achieve incident response readiness, without all the complexity, the cost, the drama,” Sandler told TechCrunch. “We want to simply enable them to reach AI-native detection response capability anywhere the data is, at scale.”\n\nLike so many cybersecurity founders, Sandler did his time in the Israeli military’s cybersecurity unit before being one of the founding employees behind Granulate, whichIntel acquired for $650 millionin 2022.
