(They didn’t take the offers.) The pair worked at Google Brain together and were early employees at Anthropic.\n\nThey earned acclaim at Google by creating the Alpha Chip — an AI tool that could generate solid chip layouts in hours — a process that normally takes human designers a year or more. The tool helped design three generations of Google’s Tensor Processing Units.\n\nThat pedigree explains why, just four months after launching Ricursive, they last month announced a$300 million Series A roundat a $4 billion valuation led by Lightspeed, just a couple of months after raising a $35 million seed round led by Sequoia.\n\nRicursive is building AI tools that design chips, not the chips themselves. That makes them fundamentally different from nearly every other AI chip startup: they’re not a wannabe Nvidia competitor. In fact, Nvidia is an investor. The GPU giant, along with AMD, Intel, and every other chip maker, are the startup’s target customers.\n\n“We want to enable any chip, like a custom chip or a more traditional chip, any kind of chip, to be built in an automated and very accelerated way. We’re using AI to do that,” Mirhoseini told TechCrunch.\n\nTheir paths first crossed at Stanford, where Goldie earned her PhD as Mirhoseini taught computer science classes. Since then, their careers have been in lockstep. “We started at Google Brain on the same day. We left Google Brain on the same day. We joined Anthropic on the same day. We left Anthropic on the same day. We rejoined Google on the same day, and then we left Google again on the same day. Then we started this company together on the same day,” Goldie recounted.\n\nDuring their time at Google, the colleagues w",

The stock closed at ₹873.70, down 7% from its issue price, lending the company a market capitalization of about ₹148.1 billion (around $1.6 billion).\n\nThat price tag marks a step down from Fractal’s recent private-market highs. In July 2025, the companyraised about $170 million in a secondary sale, at a valuation of $2.4 billion. It first crossed the $1 billion mark in January 2022 after raising $360 million from TPG,becoming India’s first AI unicorn.\n\nFractal’s IPO comes as India seeks to position itself as a key market and development hub for AI in a bid to attract investment amid increasing attention from some of the world’s most prominent AI companies. Firms such asOpenAIandAnthropichave been engaging more with the country’s government, enterprises, and developer ecosystem as they seek to tap the country’s scale, talent base, and growing appetite for AI tools and technology.\n\nThat push is on display this week in New Delhi, where India is hosting theAI Impact Summit, bringing together global technology leaders, policymakers and executives.\n\nFractal’s subdued debut followed a sharp recalibration of its IPO. In early February, the company decided to price the offering conservatively afterits bankers advised it to, cutting the IPO sizeby more than 40%to ₹28.34 billion (about $312.5 million), from the original amount of ₹49 billion ($540.3 million).\n\nFounded in 2000, Fractal sells AI and data analytics software to large enterprises across financial services, retail and healthcare, and generates the bulk of its revenue from overseas markets, including the U.S. The company pivoted toward AI in 2022 after operating as a trad",

It’s a potential game-changer for the economics and capabilities of AI models — and with $180 million in seed funding, they’ll have plenty of runway to figure it out.\n\nLast week, I spoke with the lab’s three co-founders — brothers Ben and Asher Spector, and Aidan Smith — about why this is an exciting moment to start a new AI lab and why they keep coming back to ideas about the human brain.\n\nI want to start by asking, why now? Labs like OpenAI and DeepMind have spent so much on scaling their models. I’m sure the competition seems daunting. Why did this feel like a good moment to launch a foundation model company?\n\nBen:There’s just so much to do. So, the advances that we’ve gotten over the last five to ten years have been spectacular. We love the tools. We use them every day. But the question is, is this the whole universe of things that needs to happen? And we thought about it very carefully and our answer was no, there’s a lot more to do. In our case, we thought that the data efficiency problem was sort of really the key thing to go look at. The current frontier models are trained on the sum totality of human knowledge, and humans can obviously make do with an awful lot less. So there’s a big gap there, and it’s worth understanding.\n\nWhat we’re doing is really a concentrated bet on three things. It’s a bet that this data efficiency problem is the important thing to be doing. Like, this is really a direction that is new and different and you can make progress on it. It’s a bet that this will be very commercially valuable and that will make the world a better place if we can do it. And it’s also a bet that’s sort of the right kind of team to do it is a creative and even in some ways inexperienced team that can go",

OpenAI and Anthropic are selling directly to enterprises. Every SaaS vendor now ships an AI assistant.\n\nIn the scramble for the interface, Glean is betting on something less visible: becoming the intelligence layer beneath it.\n\nSeven years ago, Glean set out to be the Google for enterprise — an AI-powered search tool designed to index and search across a company’s SaaS tool library, from Slack to Jira, Google Drive to Salesforce. Today, the company’s strategy has shifted from building a better enterprise chatbot to becoming the connective tissue between models and enterprise systems.\n\n“The layer we built initially – a good search product – required us to deeply understand people and how they work and what their preferences are,” Jain told TechCrunch on last week’sepisode of Equity, which we recorded at Web Summit Qatar. “All of that is now becoming foundational in terms of building high quality agents.”\n\nHe says that while large language models are powerful, they’re also generic.\n\n“The AI models themselves don’t really understand anything about your business,” Jain said. “They don’t know who the different people are, they don’t know what kind of work you do, what kind of products you build. So you have to connect the reasoning and generative power of the models with the context inside your company.”\n\nGlean’s pitch is that it already maps that context and can sit between the model and the enterprise data.\n\nThe Glean Assistant is often the entry point for customers — a familiar chat interface powered by a mix of leading proprietary (ie, ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) and open-source models, grounded in the company’s internal data. But what keeps customers, Jain argues, is everything underneath it.\n\nFirst is model access. Rather than forcing companies to commit to a single LLM provider, Glean acts as the abstraction layer, allowing enterprises to sw",

As MIT Technology Reviewreported last July, Chinese universities have leaned hard into AI literacy, treating AI not as a threat but instead as essential infrastructure. Nearly 60% of Chinese students and faculty now use AI tools multiple times daily, and schools like Zhejiang University have made AI coursework mandatory, while top institutions like Tsinghua have created entirely new interdisciplinary AI colleges. In China, fluency with AI isn’t optional anymore; it’s table stakes.\n\nU.S. universities are scrambling to catch up. Over the last two years, dozens have launched AI-specific programs.

In January, CEO Nwachuku said his goal was to build “Africa’s first defense prime, to build autonomous defense systems and other systems to protect our critical infrastructure and resources from armed attacks.”\n\nAt the time, Terra had just won its first federal contract. The company has government and commercial clients, and Nwachuku said Terra had already generated more than $2.5 million in commercial revenue and was protecting assets valued at around $11 billion.\n\nHe said this extension round came fast due to “strong momentum.” Other investors in the round include 8VC, Nova Global, and Resiliience17 Capital, which was founded by Flutterwave CEO Olugbenga Agboola. Nwachuku said investors saw “faster-than-expected traction” regarding deals and partnerships, which created urgency to preempt and increase their commitment. The round came about in just under two weeks, bringing the company’s total funding to $34 million.\n\nThe extended raise is not that surprising. Afterall, building a defense company is not cheap.
