Our goal is for ads to support broader access to more powerful ChatGPT features while maintaining the trust people place in ChatGPT for important and personal tasks.”\n\nThe move,which the company announced last month, drew ridicule in a series of Super Bowl ads that ran on Sunday from a top rival, Anthropic.\n\nIn its TV commercials, Anthropic poked fun at the idea that some AI companies, like OpenAI, would soon include advertising by showing how poorly integrated ads could disrupt the consumer experience. This was portrayed on-screen by glassy-eyed actors playing AI chatbots, who would deliver their advice alongside a poorly targeted ad.\n\nOpenAI CEOSam Altman got extremely testyabout the jabs,callingthe ads “dishonest” and Anthropic an “authoritarian company.”\n\nConsumers have so far resisted the idea of ads in AI responses. OpenAI faced abacklash late last yearwhen it tested app suggestions that looked like unwanted ads. Still, the AI company needs to generate revenue from its popular chatbot to cover the costs of developing its technology and growing the business.\n\nWhile understandable, critics fear that ads could influence ChatGPT’s answers. OpenAI denies this in its announcement, saying that ads will be optimized based on “what’s most helpful to you.” The company says ads will also always be clearly labeled as sponsored and separated from the organic content.\n\nIn tests, OpenA",

      "content": "After launching a“Home Safe”feature that lets users notify friends and family when they’ve arrived home safely, Snapchat is now introducing additional alerts to inform others when users have arrived at other destinations.\n\nThe social media giant announced on Monday that with its new “Arrival Notifications,” users can now set one-time or recurring alerts for locations beyond their home, providing an automatic way to share when they’ve arrived at specific places.\n\n“Arrival Notifications now work for everyday moments — like letting someone know you’re back for the night while traveling, or automatically sharing when you arrive at a weekly class, practice, or meeting — without needing to remember to send a message,” the company wrote in ablog post.\n\nAs with the platform’s Home Safe alerts, Arrival Notifications can only be sent to friends you choose to share your location with. It’s worth noting that location sharing on Snap Map is off by default. No one can see your location or receive an alert unless you choose to share it, Snapchat explained. One-time alerts expire after they’re sent or after 24 hours.\n\nTo use Arrival Notifications, you need to share your location with a trusted friend that you want to keep in the loop. Then, you need to tap on your friendship profile and scroll down to “Arrival Notifications.” You can pick a location on the map and give it a personal name. For example, you could set the location for your “run club” or the location for “piano lessons.” You can then choose a one-time or recurring alert, after which Snapchat will notify your friend when you arrive.\n\nThe new feature comes as Snapchatannounced last summer that Snap Mapnow has more than 400 million monthly active users.\n\nSnap Map, which launched in 2017, was originally a way for users to see their friends’ locations and browse public snaps from around the world. The feature now also offers ways for users todiscover local hotspotsand find things to do.\n\nWith its Home Safe and Arrival Notif",

(The app has been downloaded around 462,000 times to date, according to market intelligence providerAppfigures.) OnReddit, users have been recommending alternatives and offering each other support as they wait for any update.\n\nWhile it’s not surprising for an app to shut down, when there’s still an active user base, apps typically provide some sort of communication from their operators. But Musicboard users say they haven’t heard anything, leaving them to reach out to the press for help getting in touch with someone, if only to let them export their data.\n\nSome users organized an unofficial “Help Save Musicboard” initiative to bring more attention to the matter. The group is led by the Musicboard user known asLavariniand run by volunteers.\n\nTechCrunch contacted Musicboard to help these users get some answers and was provided a short statement. However, the statement didn’t explain the longer-term issues and dismissed the outages as “temporary downtime.”\n\nThe statement, shared from the Musicboard team email address and signed simply as “Musicboard,” said the following:\n\nApp is not shut down. The servers had temporary downtime, which has now been quickly fixed. And we’re working together with the Google Play team to get the app back up there. The app wouldn’t shut down without a respectful timeline for the users and official communication.

Discord notes that some users may be asked to use multiple methods when additional information is needed to assign an age group.\n\nThe facial age estimation requires video selfies, which Discord says never leave your device.

That’s the VC firm founded by former Salesforce co-CEO Keith Block.\n\nThe Gather team first met Smith Point a year ago at a logistics conference, and “it took Keith and his team five minutes to get what we’re doing,” co-founder and CEO Sankalp Arora told TechCrunch.\n\nWhatGather AIis doing is unusual. The three founders met as PhD students at Carnegie Mellon University, where they built one of the first autonomous helicopters and tested it on the FBI training grounds in Quantico. (Block is a trustee for CMU.)\n\nIn 2017, the founders took what they learned about teaching helicopters to fly and land safely and launched Gather AI. Using off-the-shelf cameras placed on strategic moving equipment like forklifts, as well as off-the-shelf drones flying around the warehouse, the cameras watch on-the-floor operations and log what they find into the warehouse management systems.\n\nBut the catch is, the AI isn’t being random about what it scans. It is being “curious,” as Arora described it.\n\n“My PhD work focused on how to make different kinds of flying robots curious,” he said. “So they’re curious about boxes and bar codes and workflows.”\n\nIn addition to barcodes, they look for lot codes, text, expiration dates, case counts, damages, occupancy, and other items. The idea is that they will discover and predict issues like low inventory, misplaced stock, and workflows that may cause safety issues.\n\nThey also work in environments unfriendly to people, like freezers and cold storage.\n\nBecause Gather’s underlying tech was built years before the age of large language models, this is not the kind of AI that an LLM uses.\n\n“They’re not end-to-end neural networks,” Arora explains. “They are classical Bayesian techniques, combined with neural networks.”\n\nAI vision Bayesian techniques use probability-base methods to teach computers how to",
