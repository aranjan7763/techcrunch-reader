The outfit plans to use the capital to speed up deployment of its high-speed memory chips, a critical component for the chips used for AI workloads, sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.\n\nThe round, which brought Positron to a $1 billion valuation, was co-led by Arena Private Wealth, Jump Trading, and Unless, with strategic investment from Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), the country’s sovereign wealth fund, which has been increasingly focused on building out AI infrastructure, the sources said.\n\nThe Reno-based startup’s Series B comes as hyperscalers and AI firms push to reduce their reliance on longstanding leader Nvidia. These firms include OpenAI, which, despite being one of Nvidia’s largest and most important customers, isreportedlyunsatisfied with some of the firm’s latest AI chips and has been seeking alternatives since last year.\n\nMeanwhile, Qatar, through QIA, has been accelerating a broader push into so-called “sovereign” AI infrastructure — a priority repeatedly underscored at Web Summit Qatar in Doha this week. Several sources told TechCrunch the country views compute capacity as critical to staying competitive on the global economic stage, and is positioning itself as a leading AI services hub in the Middle East, fueling interest in startups like Positron.\n\nThe strategy is already taking shape through major commitments, including a $20 billion AI infrastructurejoint venture with Brookfield Asset Managementthat was announced in December.\n\nPositron’s fundraise brings the three-year-old startup’s total capital raised to just over $300 million. The startup previously raised $75 million last year from investors including Valor Equity Partners, Atreides Management, DFJ Growth, Flume Ventures, and Resilience Reserve.\n\nThe company claims its first-generation chip, Atlas, manufactured in Arizona, can match the performance of Nvidia’s H100 G",

Attia served on the executive team of the food startup and was also anearly investor.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, Attia is a Canadian American physician who has become one of the most prominent voices in longevity and preventive health. He’s best known for his bestselling book “Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity” and his now seven-year-old podcast, wherein he explores optimization strategies. He was also hired just last month as a contributor to CBS.\n\nThree-year-old, New York-based David Protein raised a $75 million Series A funding round in May of last year led by Greenoaks, with participation from Valor Equity Partners. The company has experienced significant growth since launching its flagship protein bar in September 2024, a product it describes as having 28 grams of protein, zero sugar, and 150 calories.\n\nIn a lengthypost on X, Attia wrote that he was “ashamed” of some of the crude content in his emails with Epstein, but he also said he was not involved in criminal activity and never visited Epstein’s island or traveled on his plane. Attia also discussed at length how he came to know Epstein and why he stayed involved with him even after Epstein’s2008 conviction.\n\nThe fallout appears to extend beyond David Protein. It also appears that Biograph, the healthcare testing and longevity startup that Attia co-founded with entrepreneur John Hering, may be distancing itself from the physician.

These subpoenas have also been used to demand information about people who have criticized Trump officials or protested government policies.\n\nUnlike judicial subpoenas, which are authorized by a judge after seeing enough evidence of a crime to authorize a search or seizure of someone’s things, administrative subpoenas are issued by federal agencies, allowing investigators to seek a wealth of information about individuals from tech and phone companies without a judge’s oversight.\n\nWhile administrative subpoenas cannot be used to obtain the contents of aperson’s emails, online searches, or location data, they can demand information specifically about the user, such as what time a user logs in, from where, using which devices, and revealing the email addresses and other identifiable information about who opened an online account. But because administrative subpoenas are not backed by a judge’s authority or a court’s order, it’s largely up to a company whether to give over any data to the requesting government agency.\n\nAdministrative subpoenas are not new; the use of these self-signed demands by Trump officials to seek identifiable information about people who are critical of the president’s policies has raised alarm.\n\nBloombergreported last weekthat Homeland Security sought the identity of an anonymous Instagram account called@montocowatch, which says its goal is to share resources to help protect immigrant rights and due process across Montgomery County in Pennsylvania.

The duo are developing an “intelligent family care system” that will start with an app experience and then expand into hardware devices.\n\nTwo years after their exit from Google, Park and Friedman are betting on AI to help lighten the mental burden of caregiving. According to arecent report, 63 million, or nearly 1 in 4, U.S. adults are family caregivers, up 45% from 10 years ago.\n\nLuffu uses AI in the background to gather and organize family information, learn day-to-day patterns, and flag notable changes so families can stay aligned and address potential well-being issues.\n\n“At Fitbit, we focused on personal health—but after Fitbit, health for me became bigger than just thinking about myself,” Park said in apress release. “I was caring for my parents from across the country, trying to piece together my mom’s health care across various portals and providers, with a language barrier that made it hard to get complete, timely context from her about doctor visits. I didn’t want to constantly check in, and she didn’t want to feel monitored. Luffu is the product we wished existed—to stay on top of our family’s health, know what changed and when to step in—without hovering.”\n\nThe pair note that today’s consumer health market is filled with tools for individuals, but that real life health is shared across partners, kids, parents, pets, and caregivers. Family information is scattered across devices, portals, calendars, attachments, spreadsheets, and paper documents.\n\nWith Luffu, people will be able to track the whole family’s details, including health stats, diet, medications, symptoms, lab tests, doctor visits, and more. Users can log health information using voice, text, or photos. Luffu proactively watches for changes, and surfaces insights and alerts, such as unusual vitals or changes in sleep.\n\nThe pairtold Ax",

These numbers show some slight improvements over prior quarters, which Match attributes to AI-driven recommendations that change the order of profiles shown to women, and other product experiments.\n\nMatch said that this year, it aims to address common Gen Z pain points, including better relevance, authenticity and trust.
