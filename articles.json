      "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission closed its investigation into bankrupt electric vehicle startup Fisker  last September, roughlyone year after the probe was opened.\n\nTechCrunch learned the investigation was closed when the financial regulator responded to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request in January. The SEC’s FOIA department said it had identified “approximately 21.7 gigabytes of electronically maintained records” related to the investigation. The agency doesn’t typically make records available if investigations are still open, and it explained in a follow-up email that it “was closed in September 2025.”\n\nIt’s not clear how far the investigation progressed. The SECrevealed the existence of the probein an October 2024 filing in Fisker’s bankruptcy case. The agency wrote at the time that it had sent subpoenas to the company and that it may need to “request or subpoena additional documents in the future relating to its ongoing investigation.”\n\nA spokesperson for the agency declined to comment. Founder and former CEO Henrik Fisker did not respond to a message seeking comment.\n\nThe closure of the Fisker investigation comes amid a significant drop in enforcement actions and settlements during President Trump’s second term. The SEC initiated 313 enforcement actions in 2025 — the lowest in a decade and down 27% from the the final year of President Biden’s term, according toan analysis by law firm Paul, Weiss. Only four of those enforcement actions were against public companies. Total monetary settlements fell 45% from 2024.\n\nFisker was one of the last remaining electric vehicle startups under investigation by the SEC. Over the last few years, the agency settled fraud or other charges brought againstNikola,Lordstown Motors,Canoo,Hyzon Motors, and others. In 2023, itclosed an investigationinto Lucid Motors without a lawsuit.\n\nThe only known active investigation remaining into an electric vehicle startup is the one related to Faraday Future, which is now nearl",

The program offers commissions and technical support to those startups to assist small manufacturers and traders in reaching overseas markets.\n\nThe new partnership arrives after years of strained India–China relations. New Delhibanned dozens of Chinese-linked appsin 2020 following a deadly border clash, including major platforms such as TikTok, PUBG Mobile, and AliExpress, an e-commerce app operated by Alibaba Group. Those restrictions remain in place, making the Indian government’s public collaboration with Alibaba’s export-focused platform a carefully circumscribed form of engagement rather than a broader policy reset.\n\nIndia’s export ambitions are closely tied to its small businesses and the platforms they use to reach overseas markets. Micro, small, and medium enterprises account fornearly half of the country’s exportsand about 31% of GDP, according to the Indian government’s latest Economic Survey, underlining why New Delhi has focused on expanding digital market access for smaller firms through global B2B channels, including Alibaba.com.\n\nAlibaba.com’s B2B platform connects more than 50 million active buyers across over 200 countries and regions, said Rocky Lu, head of India business at the company.\n\n“Alibaba.com has been active in India for over two decades, and we remain dedicated to our core mission of empowering MSMEs to scale their businesses globally,” Lu told TechCrunch. “Our focus continues to be on leveraging our digital inf",

But young adults are deeplydisillusionedwith the frustrating, demoralizingstate of online dating. Why not try something different?\n\nOver 5,000 students at Stanford have given Date Drop a try since its launch in the fall. It has also rolled out at 10 more schools, including MIT, Princeton, and the University of Pennsylvania, and Weng says he wants to roll out Date Drop more broadly in some cities this summer.\n\n“Our matches convert to actual dates at about 10x the rate of Tinder,” Weng told TechCrunch. “Instead of swiping, we get to know each person deeply and send them one compatible match per week.”\n\nAt first, Weng didn’t intend to turn Date Drop into the foundation of a startup. Then, a close friend of his met their partner via Date Drop. “That was when I got the sense that this was less of a project,” he said.\n\nNow, Weng thinks of Date Drop as just the first service from his startup, TheRelationship Company, which is a public benefit corporation — a type of company legally required to consider social impact alongside profits.\n\n“This started as something I just wanted to exist on campus, and it became a company because people kept on asking for it in their schools and I needed resources to do that,” he said.\n\nAlready, Weng has raised “a few million” from some angel investors, including Zynga founder and early Facebook backer Mark Pincus, who has taught business courses at Stanford (including to Weng).

That’s a 32% increase from the preceding three days, Thursday through Saturday, where downloads totaled approximately 112,000.\n\nClaude’s daily average number of downloads from Sunday through Tuesday was 49,200, up 32% from the usual Sunday through Tuesday average of 37,400 per day.\n\nThe numbers suggest that Anthropic’s Super Bowl commercials, combined with Anthropic’s recentrelease of its new Opus 4.6 model, worked to drive attention to Claude’s app and its key differentiator from ChatGPT.

Plasmas inside the company’s Polaris prototype reactor have reached 150 million degrees Celsius, three-quarters of the way toward what the company thinks it will need to operate a commercial fusion power plant.\n\n“We’re obviously really excited to be able to get to this place,” David Kirtley, Helion’s co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch.\n\nPolaris is also operating using deuterium-tritium fuel — a mixture of two hydrogen isotopes — which Kirtley said makes Helion the first fusion company to do so. “We were able to see the fusion power output increase dramatically as expected in the form of heat,” he said.\n\nThe Everett, Washington-based startup is locked in a race with several other companies that are seeking to commercialize fusion power, a potentially unlimited source of clean energy.\n\nThat potential has investors rushing to bet on the technology. This week, Inertia Enterprises announced a$450 million Series Around that included Bessemer and GV. In January, Type One Energy told TechCrunch it was in themidst of raising $250 million, while last summer Commonwealth Fusion Systems raised$863 millionfrom investors including Google and Nvidia. Helion itself raised$425 millionlast year from a group that included Sam Altman, Mithril, Lightspeed, and SoftBank.\n\nWhile most other fusion startups are targeting the early 2030s to put electricity on the grid, Helion has a contract with Microsoft to sell it electricity starting in 2028, though that power would come from a larger commercial reactor called Orion that the company is currently building, not Polaris.\n\nEvery fusion startup has its own milestones based on the design of its reactor. Commonwealth Fusion Systems, for example, needs to heat its plasmas to more than 100 million degrees C inside of its tokamak, a doughnut-shaped device that uses powerful magnets to contain the plasma.\n\nHelion’s reactor is different, needin",

Instead of making a delivery, the driver was offered $6.25 to drive less than one mile to a Waymo vehicle and close its door. After “verified completion,” they would get an extra $5.\n\n“You actually ‘door’ dashed,” one commenter noted.\n\nIt seems too ironic to be real. Waymo vehicles represent technological breakthroughs that once seemed unfathomable. The Alphabet-owned company just raised$16 billionto take its driverless cars international!\n\nBut Waymo and DoorDash confirmed to TechCrunch that this Reddit post is legitimate. This is, in fact, a real problem.\n\n“Waymo is currently running a pilot program in Atlanta to enhance its AV fleet efficiency. In the rare event a vehicle door is left ajar, preventing the car from departing, nearby Dashers are notified, allowing Waymo to get its vehicles back on the road quickly,” Waymo and DoorDash said in a joint response. (The door-closing partnership, which beganearlier this year, is just one facet of Waymo and DoorDash’s broader relationship. In October, the companies launched an autonomous delivery service in Phoenix, where Waymo vehicles deliver food and groceries to DoorDash customers.)\n\nIf a Waymo door is left open, it’s worth it to the company to pay someone to close it — the car cannot complete any more rides if it’s left immobile. Not to mention, an unmoving car could block the flow of traffic.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Waymo has enlisted help with its door troubles. In Los Angeles, Waymo works withHonk, an app that’s like Uber for towing services. According to reports, Honk users in L.A. have been offeredup to $24to close a Waymo door — m",

You might think that xAI employees ought to be fascinated with achieving AGI, using deep learning models to disrupt traditional software companies, or simply bad wordplay like “Macrohard.” But instead, Elon is going to the moon.\n\nAfter outlining plans tobuild AI data centers in orbit, the primary synergy between the two companies, Musk took the idea further. “What if you want to go beyond a mere terawatt per year?” Musk asked. “To do that, you have to go to the moon…I really want to see a mass driver on the moon that is shooting AI satellites into deep space.”\n\nIn Musk’s telling, the step beyond data centers orbiting Earth is even larger computers in deep space. And furthermore, Musk says the best way to achieve that is to build a city on the moon to manufacture space computers and hurl them into the solar system using a big maglev train.\n\nIf that all feels a bit much, veteran Musk watchers know there’s a clue about where the discussion appears in a video of anall-hands meetingxAI shared with the public. The slide describing the moon base comes at the end of the presentation deck, where, during SpaceX pep talks, Musk typically shares renderings of SpaceX rockets landing on Mars and waxes rhapsodic about the future of multi-planetary humanity.\n\nNotably, the moon base comes just after SpaceX has publicly backed away from its long-held goal of colonizing Mars. Now, with xAI in the corporate fold, Musk needs a new science fiction metaphor for the future: In this case, theKardashev Scale, a theoretical measure of galactic civilizations coined by the eponymous Soviet astronomer in the 1960s.

This seems to suggest he believes the AI would do a better job than its human counterparts in resolving some issues.\n\nThe company also touted its recent hire of CTO Ahmad Al-Dahle,poached from Metafor his AI expertise, and its plans to create an AI-native experience.\n\nWith his guidance, Chesky said that Airbnb was poised to introduce an app that doesn’t just search for you, but one that “knows you.”\n\n“It will help guests plan their entire trip, help hosts better run their businesses, and help the company operate more efficiently at scale,” Chesky explained, adding that’s why Airbnb brought Al-Dahle on board.\n\n“Ahmad is one of the world’s leading AI experts.

He’s an expert at pairing massive technical scale with world-class design, which is exactly how we’re going to transform the Airbnb experience,” Chesky noted.\n\nLike other businesses poised for disruption by AI, Airbnb’s leadership is pushing the idea that it has a unique database and product that other AI chatbots can’t replicate.\n\n“A chatbot doesn’t have our 200 million verified identities or our 500 million proprietary reviews, and it can’t message the hosts, which 90% of our guests do,” Chesky told analysts during the earnings call.
