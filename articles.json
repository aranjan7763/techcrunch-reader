Trump has repeatedly accused Big Tech companies of censoring right-leaning content, though many major platforms have rolled back several measures to curb fake news and disinformation they had imposed in the years prior to his second stint at the White House.\n\nApple’s relationship with the Trump administration has oscillated between warm and cold over the past year.

More recently, myriad startups have tried to improve the car-buying experience with AI, pitching ideas like voice agents or smarter scheduling software. Eclipse’s Jiten Behl thinks this is the wrong approach if you want to really modernize the automotive retail experience, though.\n\n“These bolt-on AI tools are band-aids,” he said in an interview with TechCrunch. He likened it to how many major automakers’ first EVs were essentially combustion vehicles that were repackaged to fit electric drivetrains. That approach came with major tradeoffs compared to designing a new EV from the ground up, which was the approach companies like Tesla and Rivian took.\n\n“Auto retail is a perfect candidate for disrupting with AI, you know? It’s a lot of process, lot of labor, [very] rules-based,” he said.\n\nLasse-Mathias Nyberg, Ever co-founder and CEO, said in an interview that buying or selling a car typically triggers “hundreds or thousands of different actions” that a retailer needs to perform in order to complete the transaction. “There’s massive complexities or frictions on both sides.”\n\nIn 2022, he and his team set out to reduce or remove those complexities. What they settled on after a year of research was a digital-first auto retailer. The core tech is an orchestration layer or “operating system",

Improving inference efficiency reduces compute costs and cuts down the lag time between a user’s prompt and the AI’s response.\n\nModal is one of the handful of inference-focused companies attracting intense investor attention now. Last week, its competitor Baseten announced a$300 million raiseat a $5 billion valuation, more than doubling the $2.1 billion valuation it reached just months prior in September. Similarly, Fireworks AI, an inference cloud provider, secured $250 million at a $4 billion valuation in October.\n\nIn January, the creators of the open source inference project vLLM announced they had transitioned the tool into a VC-backed startup, Inferact, raising $150 million in seed funding led by Andreessen Horowitz at an$800 million valuation.

At least two flaws can be exploited by tricking someone into clicking a malicious link on their Windows computer. Another can result in a compromise on opening a malicious Office file.\n\nThe vulnerabilities are known aszero-days, because the hackers were exploiting the bugs before Microsoft had time to fix them.\n\nDetails of how to exploit the bugs have been published, Microsoft said, potentially increasing the chance of hacks. Microsoft did not say where they had been published, and a Microsoft spokesperson did not immediately comment when reached by TechCrunch. In its bug reports, Microsoft acknowledged the input of security researchers in Google’s Threat Intelligence Group in their discovery of the vulnerabilities.\n\nMicrosoft said one of the bugs, officially tracked asCVE-2026-21510, was found in the Windows shell, which powers the operating system’s user interface. The bug affects all supported versions of Windows, the company said. When a victim clicks on a malicious link from their computer, the bug allows hackers to bypass Microsoft’s SmartScreen feature that would typically screen malicious links and files for malware.\n\nAccording tosecurity expert Dustin Childs, this bug can be abused toremotely plant malwareon the victim’s computer.\n\n“There is user interaction here, as the client needs to click a link or a shortcut file,” Childs wrote in his blog post. “Still, a one-click bug to gain code execution is a rarity.”\n\nA Google spokesperson confirmed that the Windows shell bug was under “widespread, active exploitation,” and said successful hacks allowed the silent execution of malware with high privileges, “posing a high risk of subsequent system c",

This unfortunately required parting ways with some people.”\n\nHe added that the company is “hiring aggressively” and closed with a quintessentially Musk pitch: “Join xAI if the idea of mass drivers on the Moon appeals to you.”\n\nLosing half your co-founders in a relatively short period raises questions, and Musk’s comments seem designed to control the narrative, reframing the exits as necessary rather than a problem for the outfit.\n\nIn total, at least 10 engineers, including thetwo co-founders, have publicly announced their departure from xAI in the past week — though two of those exits appear to have occurred a few weeks ago.\n\nThree of the departing staff members have said they will be starting something new alongside other former xAI engineers, although no details are available about the new venture. Others have hinted at a desire for more autonomy and smaller teams to build frontier tech more rapidly, pointing to the anticipated surge in AI productivity.\n\nYuhuai (Tony) Wu, an xAI co-founder and reasoning lead,said in a postannouncing his resignation: “It’s time for my next chapter.

Elon Musk and his coterie have been talking about AI in space for years — mainly in the context of Iain Banks’ science-fiction series about a far-future universe where sentient spaceships roam and control the galaxy.\n\nNow Musk sees an opportunity to realize a version of this vision. His company SpaceX has requested regulatory permission to build solar-powered orbital data centers, distributed across as many as a million satellites, that could shift as much as 100 GW of compute power off the planet. He hasreportedlysuggested some of his AI satellites will be built on the moon.\n\n“By far the cheapest place to put AI will be space in 36 months or less,” Musk said last week on a podcast hosted by Stripe co-founder John Collison.\n\nHe’s not alone. xAI’s head of compute has reportedly bet his counterpart at Anthropic that 1% of global compute will be in orbit by 2028. Google (which has a significant ownership stake in SpaceX) has announced a space AI effort called Project Suncatcher, which will launch prototype vehicles in 2027. Starcloud, a startup that has raised $34 million backed by Google and Andreessen Horowitz, filed its own plans for an 80,000 satellite constellation last week. Even Jeff Bezos has said this is the future.\n\nBut behind the hype, what will it actually take to get data centers into space?\n\nIn a first analysis, today’s terrestrial data centers remain cheaper than those in orbit. Andrew McCalip, a space engineer, has built ahelpful calculatorcomparing the two models. His baseline results show that a 1 GW orbital data center might cost $42.4 billion — almost 3x its ground-bound equivalent, thanks to the up-front costs of building the satellites and launching them to orbit.\n\nChanging that equation, experts say, will require technology development across several fields, massive capital expenditure, and a lot of work on the supply chain for space-grade components.

Launched in 2023, the accelerator has an acceptance rate of less than 1%. In aJanuary blog post,the program said that over 19,000 startups pitched and fewer than 0.4% were accepted into the latest cohort.\n\nThe program used to focus on gaming startups, then expanded into entertainment and media, and is now a “horizontal program,” Joshua Lu, the program’s general manager and a partner at a16z, told TechCrunch. Today, founders of any type of startup can apply, and the program runs for about 12 weeks in San Francisco. It once had a program in Los Angeles, but Lu said the focus will be on SF from now on.\n\nThere are two cohorts a year, and around 50 to 70 startups are accepted into each. The programinvests up to $1 millioninto each company, though the downside is that it’s a bit pricey. It typically invests $500,000 up front in exchange for 10% of the startup’s company via a SAFE note, and another $500,000 if the next round is raised within 18 months, at whatever terms agreed to by the other investors.\n\nIn comparison, Y Combinatortypically takes a fixed 7%of the company for $125,000, with another $375,000 “invested on an uncapped MFN safe.”\n\nSpeedrun said its program is more “equity expensive” because of what it offers founders. It provides them with access to a16z’s advisory and business networks that assist with tasks like go-to-market, brand development, media strategy, and talent sourcing. Plus it offers the startups perks like $5 million in credits to vendors such as AWS, OpenAI, Nvidia, and Deel.\n\nGiven the high interest, and low acceptance rate, TechCrunch spoke to Lu for some tips on how startups can best stand out. The latest cohort began in January and will end in April with a Demo Day. Applications forthe next cohort open in April,though it looks at off-season applications year-round, Lu said.\n\nSpeedrun focuses on early-stage startups. Becau",

How do you see AI impacting those companies?\n\nI see this as being a watershed moment for startups as profound as the move to the public cloud. If you think about it, the cloud had a huge impact for startups because it meant that they no longer needed to have the real estate space to host their racks, and they didn’t need to spend as much money on the capital infusion of getting the hardware to be hosted in their labs and things like that. Everything became cheaper. Now agentic AI is going to kind of continue to reduce the overall cost of software operations again, because many of the jobs involved in standing up a new venture — whether it’s support people, legal investigations — a lot of it can be done faster and cheaper with AI agents. I think that’s going to lead to more ventures and more startups launching. And then we’re going to see higher-valuation startups with fewer people at the helm.
