      "content": "Nvidia is stepping up efforts to court India’s artificial intelligence startups earlier in their lifecycle, unveiling a string of partnerships this week aimed at reaching founders even before their companies are formally established. The push is intended to help the AI chipmaker cultivate relationships with future customers in one of the world’s fastest-growing developer markets.\n\nThe latest move comes through a partnership with early-stage venture firmActivate, which plans to back about 25 to 30 AI startups from its $75 million debut fund while giving portfolio companies preferential access to Nvidia’s technical expertise. The collaboration follows other India-focused efforts unveiled this week, including work with nonprofit AI Grants India to support early-stage founders and new ties with venture firms focused on the South Asian nation.\n\nThe flurry of activity comes as India hosts itsAI Impact Summitin New Delhi, drawing top technology companies including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang was slated to attend but skipped the event due to what the company called unforeseen circumstances. A senior delegation led by executive vice president Jay Puri attended in his place, meeting AI researchers, startups, developers, and partners on the ground.\n\nIndia has emerged as one of the fastest-growing pools of AI developers and startups, making it an increasingly important market for Nvidia as it looks to expand adoption of chips and computing software. By working more closely with founders at the earliest stages, the company is positioning itself to capture long-term demand as new AI-native companies scale.\n\nAakrit Vaish, founder of Activate, said Nvidia’s engagement with startups in India has historically been relatively light-touch compared with the U.S., but the chipmaker is now looking to work with founders much earlier in their journey. Activate aims to leverage that shift by connecting portfolio startups directly with Nvidia experts.\n\nThe VC firm, which Vaish describes as focused on “inception investing,” meets technical teams months before company formation and works closely with them as they grow. Its backers include venture capitalist Vinod Khosla, Perplexity co-founder Aravind Srinivas, Peak XV managing director Shailendra Singh, and Paytm CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma, underlining the prominent network Activate is assembling around its early-stage strategy.\n\nFor Nvidia, the logic behind partnering with an early-stage venture firm is straightforward: the earlier it builds relationships with promising AI startups, the more likely those companies are to rely on its computing infrastructure as they scale. Vaish told TechCrunch that growing startups typically consume increasing amounts of AI compute over time, making early technical engagement valuable for the chipmaker as a way of generating future business.\n\nNvidia already has a sizable presence in the country through itsInception program, which supports more than 4,000 startups in India. This week, the chipmaker alsoexpanded its local ecosystem ties, including partnerships with venture firms such as Accel, Peak XV, Z47, Elevation Capital, and Nexus Venture Partners to identify and fund AI startups. It separately teamed up with AI Grants India, co-founded by Vaibhav Domkundwar and Bhasker (Bosky) Kode, to support more than 10,000 early-stage founders over the next 12 months.\n\nThe company has also been broadening its startup outreach in India over time. In November 2025, Nvidiajoined the India Deep Tech Alliance, a consortium of U.S. and Indian investors including Accel, Blume Ventures, Premji Invest, and Celesta Capital, to provide strategic and technical guidance to emerging startups in the country.\n\nVaish said Activate’s partnership with Nvidia is designed to provide a more curated layer on top of the company’s broad-based Inception program, which serves thousands of startups globally. By serving as an early filter for high-potential technical teams, Activate aims to give its portfolio companies more direct, timely access to Nvidia’s engineering expertise.\n\nThe stepped-up activity underscores intensifying competition among global technology firms to court AI developers and startups in India, which has become one of the fastest-growing pools of technical talent outside the U.S.",

That figure is also down year-over-year from 158,000 in 2024, and 333,000 in 2023.\n\nGoogle touted how its investments in AI and other real-time defenses have helped fight these sorts of threats, but also how they served as a deterrent.\n\n“Initiatives like developer verification, mandatory pre-review checks, and testing requirements have raised the bar for the Google Play ecosystem, significantly reducing the paths for bad actors to enter,” the company’s blog post explained, adding that its “AI-powered, multi-layer protections” have been “discouraging bad actors from publishing malicious apps.”\n\nGoogle noted it now runs over 10,000 safety checks on every app it publishes and continues to recheck apps after publication. The company has also integrated its latest generative AI models into the app review process, which has helped human reviewers find more complex malicious patterns faster. Google said it plans to increase its AI investments in 2026 to stay ahead of emerging threats.\n\nIn addition, Google said it prevented more than 255,000 apps from gaining excessive access to sensitive user data, a figure that’s down from1.3 million in 2024. The company also blocked 160 million spam ratings and reviews last year, and prevented an average 0.5-star rating drop for apps targeted byreview bombing.\n\nMeanwhile, Android’s defense system, known as Google Play Protect, identified more than 27 million new malicious apps, and warned users or blocked the app from running. That’s an increase from the 13 million non-Play Store apps identified in 2024 and five million seen in 2023. These increases seem to suggest that bad actors are now more often avoiding the Play Store when targeting users with their malicious apps.",

      "content": "A year ago, Redwood Materials didn’t have an energy storage business. Now, it is the fastest-growing unit within the battery recycling and materials startup — a reflection of an AI data center building boom.\n\nThe evidence of that growth, the company says, can be found at itsR&D labin San Francisco, which has expanded four-fold into a 55,000-square-foot facility and now employs nearly 100 people. Those are small figures compared to Redwood’s total workforce of 1,200 people and its sprawling campus at its Carson City, Nevada headquarters and another facility near Reno. But its value and recent expansion are tied directly to its burgeoning energy storage that launched in June 2025.\n\nThe San Francisco facility, which opened in April 2025, is where engineers integrate the hardware, software, and power electronics for energy storage systems that power data centers, AI computing, and other large-scale industrial applications.\n\nThe companysaid in a blog postThursday the expansion will support a wave of energy storage deployments related to data centers. The company’s recent$425 million Series Eraise will provide the capital needed to scale the business. Google, a new investor, as well as existing backer Nvidia, joined the round to support Redwood’s energy storage business venture.\n\n“AI data centers have definitely been a pressing area of focus,” Claire McConnell, vice president of business development told TechCrunch in a recent interview, who added there are other use cases for its systems including supporting renewable projects like solar and wind.\n\nData centers have been around for decades, but advancements in AI have spurred a building spree and a need for reliable electricity.\n\n“What data center developers are seeing is something that they hadn’t experienced before,” McConnell said. “When they’re trying to connect to the grid, they are being told it is going to take five-plus years to get that and at the same time, you’re seeing this massive demand to build more data centers and compete in the AI race.”\n\nRedwood Materials was founded in 2017 by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel to create a circular supply chain for batteries. It initially focused on recycling scrap from battery production and consumer electronics, which was processed and then sold to customers such as Panasonic. The company also expanded into the battery materials business and today produces cathodes for battery cells.\n\nThe company openedRedwood Energylast summer to leverage the thousands of EV batteries it has collected as part of its battery-recycling business to provide power to companies. Redwood Energy’s first customer is Crusoe, a startup that, in 2021, Straubel invested in. Redwood set up an energy storage system that uses old EV batteries that are not yet ready for recycling. The system, which generates 12 MW of power and has 63 MWh of capacity, sends power to a modular data center built by Crusoe, a company best known for its large-scale data center campus in Abilene, Texas — the initial site of the Stargate project.\n\nMcConnell said customers that are in the pipeline include hyperscalers — companies that operate massive cloud computing data centers and consume hundreds of megawatts of power — that would far exceed the capacity of its project with Crusoe.\n\n“We’re working on ones in the hundreds of megawatt hours, and we have ones in the pipeline that are multiple gigawatt hours,” she said.",

Now it wants its own court, too.\n\nStarbase’s city administrator submitted aproposed ordinanceto the city commission during a meeting on Wednesday that would create a municipal court with a part-time judge, prosecutor, and court clerk. Starbase’s mayor will serve as the judge until one is appointed to a two-year term. The administrator wrote that he hopes to have a candidate ready by next month’s meeting.\n\nThe formation of a court within Starbase, which currently claims around 580 residents and sits adjacent to SpaceX’s South Texas rocket factory and launch facility, is the latest in a series of steps the city has taken to build up its own municipal services.\n\nIn addition to the volunteer fire department, Starbase is also now handling its own building permits and fire code inspections. And when a plan to contract local county sheriff’s deputies to patrol the city fell apart, the citydecided instead to start up the Starbase Police Department. (The city is still paying the Cameron County Sheriff’s Department to use its jail facilities, though, according to paperwork filed ahead of Wednesday’s meeting.)\n\nStarbase is still in the process of establishing the police department, and it expects that process could take around six months.\n\nDuring Wednesday’s meeting, the city commission reviewed an application to the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement that is required to stand up the police force. That application revealed some new details about the plans for the new Starbase Police Department.\n\nThe city wrote that its expanding population has led to an increase in calls for service. Across 2025, there were 420 calls to law enforcement in the city, 180 calls for fire service, and 140 EMS calls, according to the application. There were also 353 crashes documented in the area last year, with more than 7,000 vehicles traveling Highway 4 — the main artery in and out of Starbase — per day.\n\nThe Cameron County Sheriff’s Office has not been able to “guarantee dedicated law enforcement coverage for Starbase,” the city wrote, and Starbase’s remote geographic location “requires rapid and reliable” response times. “These limitations have raised significant concerns among residents and city leadership,” the city wrote.\n\n“The city’s unique blend of cutting-edge technology and coastal charm, coupled with high median household incomes and rising property values, drives expectations for municipal services, particularly public safety,” the city wrote in the application. The city was also sure to point out that SpaceX launches, which are expected to dramatically increase over the next few years, draw many tourists to the area. “Additionally, The City has a substantial governmental interest in ensuring the integrity of spaceflight operations occurring within its jurisdiction,” the application reads.",

      "content": "A world that runs on increasingly powerful AI coding tools is one where software creation is cheap — or so the thinking goes — leaving little room for traditional software companies.As one analyst reportput it, “vibe coding will allow startups to replicate the features of complex SaaS platforms.”\n\nCue the hand-wringing and declarations that software companies are doomed.\n\nOpen source software projects that use agents to paper over long-standing resource constraints should logically be among the first to benefit from the era of cheap code. But that equation just doesn’t quite stick. In practice, the impact of AI coding tools on open source software has been far more mixed.\n\nAI coding tools have caused as many problems as they have solved, according to industry experts. The easy-to-use and accessible nature of AI coding tools has enabled a flood of bad code that threatens to overwhelm projects. Building new features is easier than ever, but maintaining them is just as hard and threatens to further fragment software ecosystems.\n\nThe result is a more complicated story than simple software abundance. Perhaps the predicted, imminent death of the software engineer in this new AI era is premature.\n\nAcross the board, projects with open codebases are noticing a decline in the average quality of submissions, likely a result of AI tools lowering barriers to entry.\n\n“For people who are junior to the VLC codebase, the quality of the merge requests we see is abysmal,” Jean-Baptiste Kempf, the CEO ofthe VideoLAN Organizationthat oversees VLC, said in a recent interview.\n\nKempf is still optimistic about AI coding tools overall but says they’re best “for experienced developers.”\n\nThere have been similar problems forBlender, a 3D modeling tool that has been maintained as open source since 2002. Blender Foundation CEO Francesco Siddi said LLM-assisted contributions typically “wasted reviewers’ time and affected their motivation.” Blender is still developing an official policy for AI coding tools, but Siddi said they are “neither mandated nor recommended for contributors or core developers.”\n\nThe flood of merge requests has gotten so bad that open source developers are building new tools to manage it.\n\nEarlier this month, developer Mitchell Hashimoto launched a system that would limit GitHub contributions to “vouched” users, effectively closing the open-door policy for open source software. As Hashimoto put it in the announcement, “AI eliminated the natural barrier to entry that let OSS projects trust by default.”\n\nThe same effect has emerged in bug bounty programs, which give outside researchers an open door to report security vulnerabilities. The open source data transfer program cURL recentlyhalted its bug bounty programafter being overwhelmed by what creator Daniel Stenberg described as “AI slop.”\n\n“In the old days, someone actually invested a lot of time [in] the security report,” Stenberg said at a recent conference. “There was a built-in friction, but now there’s no effort at all in doing this. The floodgates are open.”\n\nIt’s particularly frustrating because many open source projects are also seeing the benefits of AI coding tools. Kempf says it’s made building new modules for VLC far easier, provided there’s an experienced developer at the helm.\n\n“You can give the model the whole codebase of VLC and say, ‘I’m porting this to a new operating system,’” Kempf said. “It is useful for senior people to write new code, but it’s difficult to manage for people who don’t know what they’re doing.”\n\nThe bigger problem for open source projects is a difference in priorities. Companies like Meta value new code and products, while open source software work focuses more on stability.\n\n“The problem is different from large companies to open source projects,” Kempf commented. “They get promoted for writing code, not maintaining it.”\n\nAI coding tools are also arriving at a moment when software, in general, is particularly fragmented.\n\nOpen source investor Konstantin Vinogradov says AI tools are running into a long-standing trend in open source engineering.\n\n“On the one hand, we have exponentially growing code base with exponentially growing number of interdependences, And on the other hand, we have number of active maintainers, which is maybe slowly growing, but definitely not keeping up,” Vinogradov said. “With AI, both parts of this equation accelerated.”\n\nIt’s a new way of thinking about AI’s impact on software engineering — one with alarming implications for the industry at large.\n\nIf you see engineering as the process of producing working software, AI coding makes it easier than ever. But if engineering is really the process of managing software complexity, AI coding tools could make it harder. At the very least, it will take a lot of active planning and work to keep the sprawling complexity in check.\n\nFor Vinogradov, the result is a familiar situation for open source projects: a lot of work to do, and not enough good engineers to do it.\n\n“AI does not increase the number of active, skilled maintainers,” he remarked. “It empowers the good ones, but all the fundamental problems just remain.”",

      "content": "Waymo’s big chance to bring its robotaxis to the state of New York has been thwarted — for now.\n\nNew York Governor Kathy Hochul withdrew a proposal that would have amended vehicle and traffic laws to effectively legalize robotaxis in the state outside of New York City. Hochul spokesperson Sean Butler confirmed to TechCrunch that the proposal has been pulled.\n\n“Based on conversations with stakeholders, including in the legislature, it was clear that the support was not there to advance this proposal,” Butler said in an emailed statement. Bloomberg was thefirst to reportthe proposal had been removed.\n\nThe withdrawal is a setback for Waymo which has tried for years — along with other autonomous vehicle (AV) companies — to test and eventually deploy robotaxis in New York.\n\n“We hear from thousands of New Yorkers who have experienced Waymo in other cities and want access to it at home,” Waymo said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch.\n\n“They want the safety, privacy, and comfort that riders in other major cities already enjoy. While we are disappointed by the Governor’s decision, we’re committed to bringing our service to New York and will work with the State Legislature to advance this issue.”\n\n“The path forward requires a collaborative approach that prioritizes transparency and public safety. We will continue to engage constructively with the Governor, the Legislature, and officials around the state to deliver this proven mobility option that New Yorkers are waiting for,” added Waymo’s statement.\n\nHochul had introduced, as part of herbroader budget proposal, a plan to change a state law that mandates drivers keep one hand on the wheel at all times. That law essentially prevents robotaxi companies like Waymo from operating in the state since no human is behind the wheel — if there is a steering wheel at all.\n\nEven if Hochul’s proposal had survived, it would not have opened the floodgates to AV companies. The proposal contained a number of limitations, including that AV companies could not deploy for-hire robotaxi services in any city with more than a million people. AV companies would also need approval from the state’s transportation commissioner, pay a $1 million fee, and show proof of financial security of at least $5 million. The state would have only backed robotaxi pilots in cities or townships where there was a clear demonstration of local support, Butler said.\n\nWith that proposal dead, the state’s existing AV pilot program, which is far more restrictive, is expected to remain. Under the pilot program, companies can seek an exemption to the one-hand on the wheel rule, allowing them to develop and test autonomous vehicles in the state, but not launch commercial robotaxi services.\n\nWaymo is currently testing in New York City, and is allowed to do so through March 31.\n\nNew York City regulators granted a permit last August to Waymo to test its robotaxis in the city. Under that permit, Waymo is allowed to test up to eight of its Jaguar I-Pace vehicles in Manhattan and downtown Brooklyn, as long as there is a human safety operator behind the wheel.\n\nWaymo is active in numerous other states and operates commercial robotaxi services in Atlanta, Austin, Miami, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and the San Francisco Bay Area. The company says it provides more than 400,000 paid rides every week and is targeting 1 million weekly rides by the end of the year.",

The model, 3.1, is currently available as a preview and will be generally released soon, the company said.\n\nGoogle’s new model may be one of the most powerful LLMs yet. Onlookers have noted that Gemini 3.1 Pro appears to be a big step up from its predecessor, Gemini 3 — which, upon its release in November,was already considereda highly capable AI tool.\n\nOn Thursday, Google also shared statistics from independent benchmarks — such as one called Humanity’s Last Exam — that showed it performing significantly better than its previous version.\n\nGemini 3.1 Pro was also praised by Brendan Foody, the CEO of AI startup Mercor, whose benchmarking system, APEX, is designed to measure how well new AI models perform real professional tasks. “Gemini 3.1 Pro is now at the top of the APEX-Agents leaderboard,” Foody saidin a social media post, adding that the model’s impressive results show “how quickly agents are improving at real knowledge work.”\n\nThe release comes as theAI model wars are heating up, and tech companies continue to release increasingly powerful LLMs designed for agentic work and multi-step reasoning. Other major names — including OpenAI and Anthropic — have recently released new models as well.",
