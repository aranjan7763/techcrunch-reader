Elon Musk and his coterie have been talking about AI in space for years — mainly in the context of Iain Banks’ science-fiction series about a far-future universe where sentient spaceships roam and control the galaxy.\n\nNow Musk sees an opportunity to realize a version of this vision. His company SpaceX has requested regulatory permission to build solar-powered orbital data centers, distributed across as many as a million satellites, that could shift as much as 100 GW of compute power off the planet. He hasreportedlysuggested some of his AI satellites will be built on the moon.\n\n“By far the cheapest place to put AI will be space in 36 months or less,” Musk said last week on a podcast hosted by Stripe co-founder John Collison.\n\nHe’s not alone. xAI’s head of compute has reportedly bet his counterpart at Anthropic that 1% of global compute will be in orbit by 2028. Google (which has a significant ownership stake in SpaceX) has announced a space AI effort called Project Suncatcher, which will launch prototype vehicles in 2027. Starcloud, a startup that has raised $34 million backed by Google and Andreessen Horowitz, filed its own plans for an 80,000 satellite constellation last week. Even Jeff Bezos has said this is the future.\n\nBut behind the hype, what will it actually take to get data centers into space?\n\nIn a first analysis, today’s terrestrial data centers remain cheaper than those in orbit. Andrew McCalip, a space engineer, has built ahelpful calculatorcomparing the two models. His baseline results show that a 1 GW orbital data center might cost $42.4 billion — almost 3x its ground-bound equivalent, thanks to the up-front costs of building the satellites and launching them to orbit.\n\nChanging that equation, experts say, will require technology development across several fields, massive capital expenditure, and a lot of work on the supply chain for space-grade components. It also depends on costs on the ground rising as re",

How do you see AI impacting those companies?\n\nI see this as being a watershed moment for startups as profound as the move to the public cloud. If you think about it, the cloud had a huge impact for startups because it meant that they no longer needed to have the real estate space to host their racks, and they didn’t need to spend as much money on the capital infusion of getting the hardware to be hosted in their labs and things like that. Everything became cheaper. Now agentic AI is going to kind of continue to reduce the overall cost of software operations again, because many of the jobs involved in standing up a new venture — whether it’s support people, legal investigations — a lot of it can be done faster and cheaper with AI agents. I think that’s going to lead to more ventures and more startups launching. And then we’re going to see higher-valuation startups with fewer people at the helm. And I think that that’s an exciting world.\n\nWhat does that look like in practice?\n\nWe are certainly seeing multistep agents becoming very broadly used across all different kinds of coding",

Both rounds were led by Founders Fund, with participation from Human Capital. The startup has been quietly testing its AI sales platform through a private beta for a while, but on Wednesday opened it up to a public beta.\n\nThe well-connected Blond brothers (Sam was previously head of sales at Brex), also attracted a bunch of big-name angels as backers: Stripe founders Patrick and John Collison, Y Combinator chief Garry Tan, and Greenoaks Capital founder Neil Mehta.\n\nSo what attracted such a venerable list of investors? Monaco is entering the crowded field of AI sales tech with a twist. It isn’t just competing with SaaS-era tech via its AI-native alternative; it’s also supplying experienced human salespeople to be experts in the AI loop, monitoring and guiding the AI’s work.\n\nThe startup is targeting young seed and Series A-level startups with a product suite that includes an AI-native customer relationship management (CRM) system and a built-from-scratch ZoomInfo-like database for finding prospects. Its AI agents can create and execute email outreach campaigns and draft follow-up emails all monitored by the human experts.

The bottleneck was always the same — most project management tools like Atlassian’s Jira and Asana simply weren’t secure enough to meet the government’s strict security standards.\n\nSo, in early 2022, Conafay launchedIntegrate, a collaboration platform designed specifically to allow private companies, the U.S. Department of Defense, and other government agencies to work jointly on classified, multi-entity projects. Last year, the Seattle-based startup won a$25 million, five-year contract from the U.S. Space Force.\n\nThat validation from a major agency was one of the reasons Wesley Chan, co-founder and managing partner at FPV Ventures, just led Integrate’s $17 million Series A. Chan, known forearly betson Canva, Robinhood, Plaid, and more than 20 other unicorns, told TechCrunch he invested because Integrate solves a big problem for the government and the private companies that serve it.\n\nUntil recently, the tech sector shunned selling to the U.S. Department of Defense, feeling that it was immoral to create products for the military. But that sentiment changed after Russia invaded Ukraine and China began to be viewed as an adversary.\n\nThis shift also means other project management companies may now want to sell their products to the government, but Conafay claims it will be technically difficult for them to catch up to Integrate.\n\n“If you don’t build something from the ground up with government requirements, you can’t really go back and re-architect software that exists for government purposes,” he told TechCrunch.\n\nAccording to Conafay, what se",

Less than a year later, they were sleeping in a camper on the side of a Canadian corn field building their robotics startup.\n\nWaterloo, Ontario-based Upside Robotics builds lightweight solar-powered autonomous robots that deliver right-sized amounts of fertilizer and nutrients to crops when they need it. The company’s software runs on proprietary algorithms to decipher when and how much fertilizer the plants need using weather and soil data.\n\nUpside’s robots currently work on corn plants — one of the most fertilizer-intensive crops — which was chosen by Upside for that exact reason, Jana Tian, co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch.\n\nAfter Tian and Sam Dugan, co-founder and chief technology officer, met at the Entrepreneurs First accelerator, they decided to focus on reducing fertilizer waste using robots because it fit squarely into the center of the Venn diagram of their interests. It also leaned well toward their backgrounds.\n\nDugan had been building robots since he was 10 years old and Tian had years of experience as a chemical engineer in the food division at Unilever.\n\nCustomer discovery with farmers further confirmed this was an area farmers were willing to pay for a better way.\n\n“Traditionally, the way the fertilizer has been applied, only 30% of the total fertilizer gets taken by the crop, so a majority of it gets wasted,” Tian said. “Farmers usually do one application per season, so they have to front-load a lot of the fertilizer. But the crops need the fertilizer during the season as well. We knew there was that problem that a lot of our growers really wanted different solutions to.”\n\nThe pair formally founded Upside Robotics in 2024 and then hit the fields — literally.\n\n“We actually bought a camper trailer, and we moved around field to field,” Dugan said. “We stayed on the side of the field every night, and we woul",

A new company calledMeridianhas emerged from stealth with a more comprehensive IDE-based approach to agentic financial modeling — and plenty of funding to build it. On Wednesday, the company announced $17 million in seed funding at a $100 million post-money valuation.\n\n“Our goal is to make financial modeling and spreadsheets way more predictable and auditable,” CEO and co-founder John Ling told TechCrunch. “How can you take a process that traditionally might have taken several hours and condense it down into like 10 minutes?”\n\nThe round was led by Andreessen Horowitz and The General Partnership, with participation from QED Investors, FPV Ventures, and Litquidity Ventures. The company says it is currently working with teams at Decagon and OffDeal, and signed $5 million of contracts in December alone.\n\nExcel agents have beena popular target for AI startups, due in part to the high cost of human-led financial analysis. But where previous Excel agentslike Shortcut AIbuilt agents into Excel, Meridian operates as a stand-alone workspace, more akin to Cursor. This allows the app to operate like an IDE, integrating data sources and other outside references that might otherwise create friction.\n\nBased in New York, the Meridian team includes both alumni of AI firms like Scale AI and Anthropic as well as financial veterans from firms like Goldman Sachs.\n\nAs Ling describes it, Meridian’s biggest challenge is the strict requirements of financial clients, which often clash with the non-deterministic nature of AI models.\n\n“If you go to 10 different software engineers at Google, and you want to add some new feature into an app, you’ll probably get like 10 completely different implementations. And that’s totally fine,” Ling says. “But if you go to 10 banking analysts at Goldman Sachs and you ask for 10 valuation models for a company, you would probably get 10 almost identical workbooks.”\n\nAs a result, the Meridian team has done ",

The move, he explained, will help xAI harness more computing power than any rival. “It’s difficult to imagine what an intelligence of that scale would think about,” he added, “but it’s going to be incredibly exciting to see it happen.”\n\nWhat Musk didn’t appear to address was how any of this would be built, or how he plans to reorganize the newly mergedxAI-SpaceXentity that is simultaneously careening toward a potentially historic IPO. He did acknowledge, proudly, that the company is in flux.\n\n“If you’re moving faster than anyone else in any given technology arena, you will be the leader,” he told employees, per the Times, “and xAI is moving faster than any other company — no one’s even close.” He added that “when this happens, there’s some people who are better suited for the early stages of a company and less suited for the later stages.”\n\nIt isn’t clear what prompted the all-hands, but the timing, whatever its cause, is at least curious. On Monday night, xAI co-founder Tony Wu announced he was leaving. Less than a day later, another xAI co-founder, Jimmy Ba, who reported directly to Musk, said he was bouncing, too.\n\nThat brings the total tosix of xAI’s 12 founding members who have now left the young company. The splits have all been described as copacetic, and with aSpaceX IPOreportedly targeting a $1.5 trillion valuation coming as soon as this summer, everyone involved stands to do very well financially on their way out the door.\n\nThe moon itself is a more recent preoccupation.
