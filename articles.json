      "content": "For the most sought-after founders, the prestige of a top-tier accelerator is increasingly weighed against giving up a significant ownership stake in their company.\n\nAli Partovi, the veteran investor and CEO ofventure firm Neo, wants to offer the mentorship and community of one of the most elite accelerator programs—without forcing the best up-and-coming tech leaders to hand over7%or even10%of their company before they’ve even started.\n\nPartovi, who is known for his early investments in Facebook, Cursor, and Kalshi, has just introducedNeo Residency, a new, competitively structured program that combines the firm’s now four-year-old accelerator with a track for current college students.\n\nThe terms that Neo Residency offers are so founder-friendly as to be “not even comparable to any other accelerator,” Partovi told TechCrunch.\n\nFor the cohort of 12 to 15 startups entering the program this summer, Neo will invest $750,000 via an uncapped SAFE — a contract that gives an investor future equity in exchange for money now, with no ceiling on the valuation used to calculate that stake. Unlike the fixed-percentage deals typical of other accelerators, Neo won’t receive its equity until the company’s next formal funding round, and even then, the dilution is tied to valuation. If a startup raises its next round at a $15 million valuation, Neo’s stake will be 5%, but if that valuation hits $100 million, the firm’s ownership drops to just 0.75%.\n\n“We take the risk up front, so this is extremely favorable to startups,” Partovi said.\n\nIn comparison, Y Combinatortypically takes a fixed 7%of the company for $125,000, with another $375,000 invested on an uncapped MFN — or most-favored nation — SAFE, a clause that ensures early investors get terms at least as good as those given to later ones. Meanwhile, Andreessen Horowitz’s Speedrun program typically invests $500,000 in exchange for 10% of the startup via a SAFE note, and another $500,000 if the next round is raised within 18 months at whatever terms are agreed to by the other investors.\n\n“We’re offering a deal so great that it’s appropriate even for founders who are not even considering any other accelerator,” Partovi said.\n\nThe lower equity cost is only part of Neo Residency’s appeal.\n\nThe founders will work for three months at Neo’s offices in San Francisco’s Jackson Square district, participate in a two-week bootcamp in the Oregon mountains, and be mentored by about 30 experienced operators, including Russell Kaplan, president of Cognition, and Fuzzy Khosrowshahi, CTO of Notion (and the creator ofGoogle Sheetsand also Partovi’s uncle).\n\nBut the program’s main draw is its prestige: Seed and Series A investors generally have great respect for founders handpicked by Partovi.\n\n“The one [accelerator] I like right now that has very high signal, and every founder I met there is just wicked smart, is Neo,” Wesley Chan, co-founder and managing partner of FPV Ventures,said on stage at 2025 TechCrunch Disrupt.\n\nStartups that have gone through the program include Moment, a fintech company that has raised$56 millionfrom investors like Andreessen Horowitz, and Anterior, a healthcare AI startup backed by NEA and Sequoia.\n\nThe Neo Residency will also select five to eight students—either as individuals or small teams—who will receive a $40,000, no-strings-attached grant to take a semester off to work on a project. While there is no requirement to drop out or start a formal company immediately, Partovi said he hopes the students will catch the entrepreneurial bug and, when they eventually launch a startup, turn to Neo for funding.\n\nNeo is keeping the program small and elite: it will cap its two annual cohorts at 20 teams each, consisting of a mix of active startups and student projects.\n\nWhy is Neo offering such generous terms? “We have more confidence in our ability to attract and pick out future superstars than ever before,” Partovi said.\n\nHis track record suggests that confidence is well-founded. He famously met Cursor co-founder Michael Truell while Truell was still an MIT student and later wrote one of the first checks into the AI coding startup, now valued at nearly$30 billion.",

      "content": "Nvidia is stepping up efforts to court India’s artificial intelligence startups earlier in their lifecycle, unveiling a string of partnerships this week aimed at reaching founders even before their companies are formally established. The push is intended to help the AI chipmaker cultivate relationships with future customers in one of the world’s fastest-growing developer markets.\n\nThe latest move comes through a partnership with early-stage venture firmActivate, which plans to back about 25 to 30 AI startups from its $75 million debut fund while giving portfolio companies preferential access to Nvidia’s technical expertise. The collaboration follows other India-focused efforts unveiled this week, including work with nonprofit AI Grants India to support early-stage founders and new ties with venture firms focused on the South Asian nation.\n\nThe flurry of activity comes as India hosts itsAI Impact Summitin New Delhi, drawing top technology companies including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang was slated to attend but skipped the event due to what the company called unforeseen circumstances. A senior delegation led by executive vice president Jay Puri attended in his place, meeting AI researchers, startups, developers, and partners on the ground.\n\nIndia has emerged as one of the fastest-growing pools of AI developers and startups, making it an increasingly important market for Nvidia as it looks to expand adoption of chips and computing software. By working more closely with founders at the earliest stages, the company is positioning itself to capture long-term demand as new AI-native companies scale.\n\nAakrit Vaish, founder of Activate, said Nvidia’s engagement with startups in India has historically been relatively light-touch compared with the U.S., but the chipmaker is now looking to work with founders much earlier in their journey. Activate aims to leverage that shift by connecting portfolio startups directly with Nvidia experts.\n\nThe VC firm, which Vaish describes as focused on “inception investing,” meets technical teams months before company formation and works closely with them as they grow. Its backers include venture capitalist Vinod Khosla, Perplexity co-founder Aravind Srinivas, Peak XV managing director Shailendra Singh, and Paytm CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma, underlining the prominent network Activate is assembling around its early-stage strategy.\n\nFor Nvidia, the logic behind partnering with an early-stage venture firm is straightforward: the earlier it builds relationships with promising AI startups, the more likely those companies are to rely on its computing infrastructure as they scale. Vaish told TechCrunch that growing startups typically consume increasing amounts of AI compute over time, making early technical engagement valuable for the chipmaker as a way of generating future business.\n\nNvidia already has a sizable presence in the country through itsInception program, which supports more than 4,000 startups in India. This week, the chipmaker alsoexpanded its local ecosystem ties, including partnerships with venture firms such as Accel, Peak XV, Z47, Elevation Capital, and Nexus Venture Partners to identify and fund AI startups. It separately teamed up with AI Grants India, co-founded by Vaibhav Domkundwar and Bhasker (Bosky) Kode, to support more than 10,000 early-stage founders over the next 12 months.\n\nThe company has also been broadening its startup outreach in India over time. In November 2025, Nvidiajoined the India Deep Tech Alliance, a consortium of U.S. and Indian investors including Accel, Blume Ventures, Premji Invest, and Celesta Capital, to provide strategic and technical guidance to emerging startups in the country.\n\nVaish said Activate’s partnership with Nvidia is designed to provide a more curated layer on top of the company’s broad-based Inception program, which serves thousands of startups globally. By serving as an early filter for high-potential technical teams, Activate aims to give its portfolio companies more direct, timely access to Nvidia’s engineering expertise.\n\nThe stepped-up activity underscores intensifying competition among global technology firms to court AI developers and startups in India, which has become one of the fastest-growing pools of technical talent outside the U.S.",

That figure is also down year-over-year from 158,000 in 2024, and 333,000 in 2023.\n\nGoogle touted how its investments in AI and other real-time defenses have helped fight these sorts of threats, but also how they served as a deterrent.\n\n“Initiatives like developer verification, mandatory pre-review checks, and testing requirements have raised the bar for the Google Play ecosystem, significantly reducing the paths for bad actors to enter,” the company’s blog post explained, adding that its “AI-powered, multi-layer protections” have been “discouraging bad actors from publishing malicious apps.”\n\nGoogle noted it now runs over 10,000 safety checks on every app it publishes and continues to recheck apps after publication. The company has also integrated its latest generative AI models into the app review process, which has helped human reviewers find more complex malicious patterns faster. Google said it plans to increase its AI investments in 2026 to stay ahead of emerging threats.\n\nIn addition, Google said it prevented more than 255,000 apps from gaining excessive access to sensitive user data, a figure that’s down from1.3 million in 2024. The company also blocked 160 million spam ratings and reviews last year, and prevented an average 0.5-star rating drop for apps targeted byreview bombing.\n\nMeanwhile, Android’s defense system, known as Google Play Protect, identified more than 27 million new malicious apps, and warned users or blocked the app from running. That’s an increase from the 13 million non-Play Store apps identified in 2024 and five million seen in 2023. These increases seem to suggest that bad actors are now more often avoiding the Play Store when targeting users with their malicious apps.",

      "content": "A year ago, Redwood Materials didn’t have an energy storage business. Now, it is the fastest-growing unit within the battery recycling and materials startup — a reflection of an AI data center building boom.\n\nThe evidence of that growth, the company says, can be found at itsR&D labin San Francisco, which has expanded four-fold into a 55,000-square-foot facility and now employs nearly 100 people. Those are small figures compared to Redwood’s total workforce of 1,200 people and its sprawling campus at its Carson City, Nevada headquarters and another facility near Reno. But its value and recent expansion are tied directly to its burgeoning energy storage that launched in June 2025.\n\nThe San Francisco facility, which opened in April 2025, is where engineers integrate the hardware, software, and power electronics for energy storage systems that power data centers, AI computing, and other large-scale industrial applications.\n\nThe companysaid in a blog postThursday the expansion will support a wave of energy storage deployments related to data centers. The company’s recent$425 million Series Eraise will provide the capital needed to scale the business. Google, a new investor, as well as existing backer Nvidia, joined the round to support Redwood’s energy storage business venture.\n\n“AI data centers have definitely been a pressing area of focus,” Claire McConnell, vice president of business development told TechCrunch in a recent interview, who added there are other use cases for its systems including supporting renewable projects like solar and wind.\n\nData centers have been around for decades, but advancements in AI have spurred a building spree and a need for reliable electricity.\n\n“What data center developers are seeing is something that they hadn’t experienced before,” McConnell said. “When they’re trying to connect to the grid, they are being told it is going to take five-plus years to get that and at the same time, you’re seeing this massive demand to build more data centers and compete in the AI race.”\n\nRedwood Materials was founded in 2017 by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel to create a circular supply chain for batteries. It initially focused on recycling scrap from battery production and consumer electronics, which was processed and then sold to customers such as Panasonic. The company also expanded into the battery materials business and today produces cathodes for battery cells.\n\nThe company openedRedwood Energylast summer to leverage the thousands of EV batteries it has collected as part of its battery-recycling business to provide power to companies. Redwood Energy’s first customer is Crusoe, a startup that, in 2021, Straubel invested in. Redwood set up an energy storage system that uses old EV batteries that are not yet ready for recycling. The system, which generates 12 MW of power and has 63 MWh of capacity, sends power to a modular data center built by Crusoe, a company best known for its large-scale data center campus in Abilene, Texas — the initial site of the Stargate project.\n\nMcConnell said customers that are in the pipeline include hyperscalers — companies that operate massive cloud computing data centers and consume hundreds of megawatts of power — that would far exceed the capacity of its project with Crusoe.\n\n“We’re working on ones in the hundreds of megawatt hours, and we have ones in the pipeline that are multiple gigawatt hours,” she said.",

Now it wants its own court, too.\n\nStarbase’s city administrator submitted aproposed ordinanceto the city commission during a meeting on Wednesday that would create a municipal court with a part-time judge, prosecutor, and court clerk. Starbase’s mayor will serve as the judge until one is appointed to a two-year term. The administrator wrote that he hopes to have a candidate ready by next month’s meeting.\n\nThe formation of a court within Starbase, which currently claims around 580 residents and sits adjacent to SpaceX’s South Texas rocket factory and launch facility, is the latest in a series of steps the city has taken to build up its own municipal services.\n\nIn addition to the volunteer fire department, Starbase is also now handling its own building permits and fire code inspections. And when a plan to contract local county sheriff’s deputies to patrol the city fell apart, the citydecided instead to start up the Starbase Police Department. (The city is still paying the Cameron County Sheriff’s Department to use its jail facilities, though, according to paperwork filed ahead of Wednesday’s meeting.)\n\nStarbase is still in the process of establishing the police department, and it expects that process could take around six months.\n\nDuring Wednesday’s meeting, the city commission reviewed an application to the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement that is required to stand up the police force. That application revealed some new details about the plans for the new Starbase Police Department.\n\nThe city wrote that its expanding population has led to an increase in calls for service. Across 2025, there were 420 calls to law enforcement in the city, 180 calls for fire service, and 140 EMS calls, according to the application. There were also 353 crashes documented in the area last year, with more than 7,000 vehicles traveling Highway 4 — the main artery in and out of Starbase — per day.\n\nThe Cameron County Sheriff’s Office has not been able to “guarantee dedicated law enforcement coverage for Starbase,” the city wrote, and Starbase’s remote geographic location “requires rapid and reliable” response times. “These limitations have raised significant concerns among residents and city leadership,” the city wrote.\n\n“The city’s unique blend of cutting-edge technology and coastal charm, coupled with high median household incomes and rising property values, drives expectations for municipal services, particularly public safety,” the city wrote in the application. The city was also sure to point out that SpaceX launches, which are expected to dramatically increase over the next few years, draw many tourists to the area. “Additionally, The City has a substantial governmental interest in ensuring the integrity of spaceflight operations occurring within its jurisdiction,” the application reads.",

      "content": "A world that runs on increasingly powerful AI coding tools is one where software creation is cheap — or so the thinking goes — leaving little room for traditional software companies.As one analyst reportput it, “vibe coding will allow startups to replicate the features of complex SaaS platforms.”\n\nCue the hand-wringing and declarations that software companies are doomed.\n\nOpen source software projects that use agents to paper over long-standing resource constraints should logically be among the first to benefit from the era of cheap code. But that equation just doesn’t quite stick. In practice, the impact of AI coding tools on open source software has been far more mixed.\n\nAI coding tools have caused as many problems as they have solved, according to industry experts. The easy-to-use and accessible nature of AI coding tools has enabled a flood of bad code that threatens to overwhelm projects. Building new features is easier than ever, but maintaining them is just as hard and threatens to further fragment software ecosystems.\n\nThe result is a more complicated story than simple software abundance. Perhaps the predicted, imminent death of the software engineer in this new AI era is premature.\n\nAcross the board, projects with open codebases are noticing a decline in the average quality of submissions, likely a result of AI tools lowering barriers to entry.\n\n“For people who are junior to the VLC codebase, the quality of the merge requests we see is abysmal,” Jean-Baptiste Kempf, the CEO ofthe VideoLAN Organizationthat oversees VLC, said in a recent interview.\n\nKempf is still optimistic about AI coding tools overall but says they’re best “for experienced developers.”\n\nThere have been similar problems forBlender, a 3D modeling tool that has been maintained as open source since 2002. Blender Foundation CEO Francesco Siddi said LLM-assisted contributions typically “wasted reviewers’ time and affected their motivation.” Blender is still developing an official policy for AI coding tools, but Siddi said they are “neither mandated nor recommended for contributors or core developers.”\n\nThe flood of merge requests has gotten so bad that open source developers are building new tools to manage it.\n\nEarlier this month, developer Mitchell Hashimoto launched a system that would limit GitHub contributions to “vouched” users, effectively closing the open-door policy for open source software. As Hashimoto put it in the announcement, “AI eliminated the natural barrier to entry that let OSS projects trust by default.”\n\nThe same effect has emerged in bug bounty programs, which give outside researchers an open door to report security vulnerabilities. The open source data transfer program cURL recentlyhalted its bug bounty programafter being overwhelmed by what creator Daniel Stenberg described as “AI slop.”\n\n“In the old days, someone actually invested a lot of time [in] the security report,” Stenberg said at a recent conference. “There was a built-in friction, but now there’s no effort at all in doing this. The floodgates are open.”\n\nIt’s particularly frustrating because many open source projects are also seeing the benefits of AI coding tools. Kempf says it’s made building new modules for VLC far easier, provided there’s an experienced developer at the helm.\n\n“You can give the model the whole codebase of VLC and say, ‘I’m porting this to a new operating system,’” Kempf said. “It is useful for senior people to write new code, but it’s difficult to manage for people who don’t know what they’re doing.”\n\nThe bigger problem for open source projects is a difference in priorities. Companies like Meta value new code and products, while open source software work focuses more on stability.\n\n“The problem is different from large companies to open source projects,” Kempf commented. “They get promoted for writing code, not maintaining it.”\n\nAI coding tools are also arriving at a moment when software, in general, is particularly fragmented.\n\nOpen source investor Konstantin Vinogradov says AI tools are running into a long-standing trend in open source engineering.\n\n“On the one hand, we have exponentially growing code base with exponentially growing number of interdependences, And on the other hand, we have number of active maintainers, which is maybe slowly growing, but definitely not keeping up,” Vinogradov said. “With AI, both parts of this equation accelerated.”\n\nIt’s a new way of thinking about AI’s impact on software engineering — one with alarming implications for the industry at large.\n\nIf you see engineering as the process of producing working software, AI coding makes it easier than ever. But if engineering is really the process of managing software complexity, AI coding tools could make it harder. At the very least, it will take a lot of active planning and work to keep the sprawling complexity in check.\n\nFor Vinogradov, the result is a familiar situation for open source projects: a lot of work to do, and not enough good engineers to do it.\n\n“AI does not increase the number of active, skilled maintainers,” he remarked. “It empowers the good ones, but all the fundamental problems just remain.”",

      "content": "Move over, PayPal mafia: There’s a new tech mafia in Silicon Valley. As the startup behind ChatGPT, OpenAI is arguably the biggest AI player in town. The company is reportedly now in talks to finalize a $100 billion deal, valuing thecompany at more than $850 billion.\n\nMany employees have come and gone since the company first launched a decade ago, and some have launched startups of their own. Among these, some have become top rivals (like Anthropic), while others, just on investor interest alone, have managed to raise billions without even launching a product (see, Thinking Machine Labs).\n\nIn January, Aliisa Rosenthal, OpenAI’s first sales leader, spoke a little bit about this growing network. She,like the other OpenAI alumswho did not become founders, decided to become an investor and said she was going to tap into the ex-OpenAI founder network to look for deal flow. We know Peter Deng, OpenAI’s former head of consumer products (and now general partner at Felicis)already has.\n\nBelow is a roundup of the major startups founded by OpenAI alumni, in alphabetical order. And we are certain this list will grow over time.\n\nDavid Luan was OpenAI’s engineering VP until he left in 2020. After a stint at Google, in 2021 he co-founded Adept AI Labs, a startup that builds AI tools for employees. The startuplast raised $350 million at a valuation northof $1 billion in 2023, but Luanleft in late 2024 to oversee Amazon’s AI agents labafterAmazon hired Adept’s founders.\n\nSiblings Dario and Daniela Amodei left OpenAI in 2021 to form their own startup, San Francisco-based Anthropic, that has longtouteda focus on AI safety. OpenAI co-founder John Schulmanjoined Anthropic in 2024, pledging to build a “safe AGI.” The company has since become OpenAI’s biggest rival and just raiseda $30 billion Series G, nabbing a $380 billion valuationin the process. IPOrumors are also swirling,as the company reportedly prepares for a public listing that could come sometime this year. (OpenAI is also allegedly preparing for an IPO this year and ismaybe even trying to beat Anthropicto the public market.)\n\nThree ex-OpenAI staffers (Rhythm Garg, Linden Li, and Yash Patil) have reportedly raised $20 million for a startup called Applied Compute, asreported by Upstart Media.All three of them worked as technical staff at OpenAI for more than a year before leaving last May to launch the startup,per their LinkedIns. The startup helps enterprises train and deploy custom AI agents. Benchmark led the round, valuing the 10-month-old company at $100 million, Upstart Media reported.\n\nThe trio all worked at OpenAI in 2016 and 2017 as research scientists before founding Covariant, a Berkeley, California-based startup that builds foundation AI models for robots. In 2024, Amazon hired all three of the Covariant founders and about a quarter of its staff. The quasi-acquisition wasviewed by someas part of a broader trend of Big Tech attempting to avoid antitrust scrutiny.\n\nTim Shi was an early member of OpenAI’s team, where he focused on building safe artificial general intelligence (AGI), according to his LinkedIn profile. He worked at OpenAI for a year in 2017 but left to found Cresta, a San Francisco-based AI contact center startup that has raised over $270 million from VCs like Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, and others, according to apress release.\n\nJonas Schneider led OpenAI’s software engineering for robotics team but left in 2019 to co-found Daedalus, which builds advanced factories for precision components. The San Francisco-based startupraised a $21 million Series A last yearwith backing from Khosla Ventures, among others.\n\nComputer vision expert Andrej Karpathy was a founding member and research scientist at OpenAI, leavingthe startup to join Tesla in 2017to lead its autopilot program. Karpathy is also well-known for his YouTubevideosexplaining core AI concepts. He left Tesla in 2024 tofound his own education technology startup, Eureka Labs, a San Francisco-based startup that is building AI teaching assistants.\n\nMargaret Jennings worked at OpenAI in 2022 and 2023 until she left to co-found Kindo, whichmarkets itself as an AI chatbot for enterprises.Kindo has raised over $27 million in funding, lastraisinga $20.6 million Series A in 2024. Jennings left Kindo in 2024 to head product and research at French AI startup Mistral, according to her LinkedIn profile.\n\nMaddie Hall worked on “special projects” at OpenAI but left in 2019 to co-found Living Carbon, a San Francisco-based startup that aims to create engineered plants that can suck more carbon out of the sky to fight climate change. Living Carbon raised a $21 million Series A round in 2023, bringing its total funding until then to $36 million, according to apress release.\n\nLiam Fedus, OpenAI’s VP of post-training research, left the company in March 2025 to team up with his former Google Brain colleague, Ekin Dogus Cubuk, andlaunch Periodic Labs.The startup seeks to use AI scientists to find new materials, particularly new superconducting materials. It came out of stealth mode in September 2025,armed with a massive $300 millionin seed-round funding with backers that included Jezz Bezos, Eric Schmidt, Felicis and Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nAravind Srinivas worked as a research scientist at OpenAI for a year until 2022, when he left the company to co-found AI search engine Perplexity. His startup has attracted a string of high-profile investors like Jeff Bezos and Nvidia, although it’s alsocaused controversyover alleged unethical web scraping. Perplexity, which is based in San Francisco, last reported araise of $200 million at a $20 billion valuation.\n\nJeff Arnold worked as OpenAI’s head of operations for five months in 2016 before co-founding San Francisco-based accounting startup Pilot in 2017. Pilot, which focused initially on doing accounting for startups,last raised a $100 million Series C in 2021 at a $1.2 billion valuationand has attracted investors like Jeff Bezos. Arnold worked as Pilot’s COO untilleavingin 2024 to launch a VC fund.\n\nShariq Hashme worked for OpenAI for 9 months in 2017 on a bot that could play the popular video game Dota, per his LinkedIn profile. After a few years at data-labeling startup Scale AI, he co-founded London-based Prosper Robotics in 2021. The startup says it’s working on a robot butler for people’s homes, a hot trend in robotics that other playerslike Norway’s 1XandTexas-based Apptronikare also working on.\n\nOpenAI co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskeverleft OpenAI in May 2024after he was reportedlypart of a failed effortto replaceCEO Sam Altman. Shortly afterward, heco-founded Safe Superintelligence, or SSI, with “one goal and one product: a safe superintelligence,” he says. Details about what exactly the startup is up to are scant: It has no product and no revenue yet. But investors are clamoring for a piece anyway, and it’s been able to raise $2 billion, with its latest valuation reportedlyrising to $32 billionthis month. SSI is based in Palo Alto, California, and Tel Aviv, Israel.\n\nEmmett Shear is the former CEO of Twitch who wasOpenAI’s interim CEO in November 2023for a few days beforeSam Altman rejoined the company. Shear launched an AI company, StemAI, in 2024 (though it seems to have since rebranded asSoftmax). The company, which appears to be a research company, has attracted funding from Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nMira Murati, OpenAI’s CTO, left OpenAI to found her own company, Thinking Machines Lab, whichemerged from stealthin February 2025. It said at the time (rather vaguely) that it will build AI that’s more “customizable” and “capable.” The San Francisco AI startup, now valued at $12 billion, announced its first product late last year: an API that fine-tunes language models. It recently made headlines when two of its co-founders announced earlier this year that theywould return to OpenAI.\n\nKyle Kosic left OpenAI in 2023 to become a co-founder and infrastructure lead of xAI, Elon Musk’s AI startup that offers a rival chatbot, Grok. In 2024, however, hehopped backto OpenAI, where he remains. Meanwhile, xAI (which acquired Musk’s social media site X) was purchased byMusk’s SpaceX, giving the coalesce company a valuation of $1.25 trillion. It islooking to go public sometime in Junefor what could be a historic listing.\n\nAngela Jiang left OpenAI in 2024, after working as a product manager and on the public policy team. In April 2025, shequietly launched Worktrace, which uses AI to help enterprisesmake business operations more efficient.It observes employee work patterns and automates workflow, according to the company’s website. The business is backed by Mura Murati, OpenAI’s former CTO, who went on to launch Thinking Labs. It is also backed by OpenAI’s startup fund, in addition to a slew of other OpenAI names, like its chief strategy officer, Jason Kwon.\n\nIn addition to these startups, a number of other former OpenAI employees have founded startups that are still in stealth mode, according to various updates TechCrunch found on LinkedIn. For instance, it seems that former OpenAI researcher Danilo Hellermark has been working on a generative AI stealth startup for the past few years. He officially left OpenAI at the beginning of 2023. There’salso one apparently in the works from Lucas Negritto,who worked on OpenAI’s technical team and left the company in 2023 after three years. Since then, he’s founded one startup and has been working on another since August 2025, according to his LinkedIn.",
