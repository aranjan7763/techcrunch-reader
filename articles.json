Instead of responding to an analyst’s question about how the tech giant is thinking about AI partnerships, such as the one with Apple to power AI for Siri, the question was completely ignored.\n\nThat decision tells us something, though — Alphabet isn’t ready to talk about how this partnership will impact its core business, which is increasingly focused on AI.\n\nOver the years, the Google-Apple relationship has been mutually beneficial. The two companies’ search partnership saw the search giant paying the iPhone maker$20 billionto be the default search engine on Apple devices,filingsfrom the Department of Justice’s lawsuit against the search giant revealed. In turn, Google gained access to Apple’s massive customer base — the iPhone maker last quarterannouncedit has 2.5 billion active devices worldwide, to give you an idea of scale.\n\nThe latest Apple AI deal isrumored to cost Apple roughly $1 billion per year, but the payoff beyond that for Google isn’t as immediately obvious as it is with search. In Google Search, consumers see links to advertisers’ websites at the top of their search results. Ads in AI Mode, which could one day represent the future of Google’s search business, are still an “experiment” for now.\n\nThe company firstannouncedlast May that it would bring ads to AI Mode, the chatbot-style interface for Google Search, but these tests see the ads’ placement below or integrated into the chatbot’s responses. Google is also trying outagentic shopping,including Shop with AI Mode, to guide consumers with product-related queries to a seamless checkout experience from the AI interface.\n\nMeanwhile, Google’s AI competitor Anthropic is taking aim at ad-supported AI withits forthcoming Super Bowl ad,which challenges the business model being adopted by ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Google.\n\nHow this will all play out longer-term is s",

Start by listening. Try a nature walk! And then twists into an ad for a fictitious (we hope!) cougar-dating site called Golden Encounters. Anthropic finishes the spot by saying that while ads are coming to AI, they won’t be coming to its own chatbot, Claude.\n\nAnother commercialfeatures a slight young man looking for advice on building a six pack.

And they caused an immediate stir, spawning headlines that Anthropic“mocks,”“skewers,”and“dunks on”OpenAI.\n\nThey are funny enough that even Sam Altmanadmitted on Xthat he laughed at them.

They inspired him to write a novella-sized rant that devolved into calling his rival “dishonest” and “authoritarian.”\n\nFirst, the good part of the Anthropic ads: they are funny, and I laughed.But I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest. Our most important principle for ads says that we won’t do exactly this; we would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic…\n\nIn that post, Altman explains that an ad-supported tier is intended to shoulder the burden of offering free ChatGPT to many of its millions of users.

The department will be run by a chief of police elected by the city’s commission, and is expected to hire eight officers, according to local news outletValley Central. It could be up and running in a few months.\n\n“There is a lot of assets here with the operations of SpaceX,” Starbase city administrator Kent Myers told the outlet. “Those assets need to be protected, and so the police department will play a critical part in protecting those assets.”\n\nIt’s not clear if Starbase has submitted its application to the TCOLE yet. The city and the TCOLE did not respond to requests for comment. Starbase reportedly hired security consulting firm Vision Quest Solutions to build out the department.\n\nStarbase is where SpaceX makes and tests its prototype Starship rocket. The city is small — it is currently home to just a few hundred residents, most of whom are SpaceX employees (or family of those workers). But it is geographically isolated. The closest neighboring town is Brownsville, which is about 10 miles away, though the drive can take 45 minutes or longer.\n\nA police department would be the latest addition to public services that have become available in Starbase since it was incorporatedas a city last year. In October, a handful of SpaceX employees who live at Starbasestarted a volunteer fire department.

The company’s latest quarterly earnings report shows that, so far, the firm is having moderate success with that strategy.\n\nIn Q4, Snap’s revenuewas $1.7 billion, which is up 10% year-over-year. Its average revenue per user was also up, slightly (to $3.62 from $3.44). The company’s net income was $45 million, up from $9 million the previous year, its earnings report shows.\n\nThe company has also continued to generate a significant amount of revenue from Snap+, the paid subscription service that the platformlaunched back in 2022. The service’s subscribers grew 71% year-over-year, reaching 24 million.\n\nWhile those numbers might seem to suggest a company whose trajectory is headed in the right direction, the earnings report also shows the platform had slightly fewer daily active users last quarter — dropping from 477 million to 474 million. Those users fell away in North America and Europe, the report shows, while growing slightly throughout the rest of the world.\n\nReuters also reportsthat the company expects its revenue during the first quarter of this year to be below analysts’ previous estimates, as competition from Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok cuts into its advertising earnings.\n\nDuring Wednesday’s earnings call, CEO Evan Spiegel focused on the company’s newer offerings, including its recent effort tocharge users for Memoriesstorage — a feature that lets users save and store their Snaps — and its plans to launch Specs later this year. The company has not launched a public-facing version of the augmented-reality glasses since 2019.

These numbers show some slight improvements over prior quarters, which Match attributes to AI-driven recommendations that change the order of profiles shown to women, and other product experiments.\n\nMatch said that this year, it aims to address common Gen Z pain points, including better relevance, authenticity, and trust.

By combining the old systems of predictive AI with more contemporary tools, the company believes it can reshape how large enterprises analyze their data.\n\n“While LLMs have been great at working with unstructured data, like text, audio, video, and code, they don’t work well with structured data like tables,” CEO Jeremy Fraenkel told TechCrunch. “With our model Nexus, we have built the best foundation model to handle that type of data.”\n\nThe idea has already drawn significant interest from investors. The company is emerging from stealth with $255 million in funding at a $1.2 billion valuation. The bulk of it comes from the recent $225 million Series A round led by Oak HC/FT, Valor Equity Partners, Battery Ventures, and Salesforce Ventures; Hetz Ventures also participated in the Series A, with angel funding from Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas, Brex co-founder Henrique Dubugras, and Datadog CEO Olivier Pomel.\n\nCalled a Large Tabular Model (LTM) rather than a Large Language Model (LLM), Fundamental’s Nexus breaks from contemporary AI practices in a number of significant ways. The model is deterministic — that is, it will give the same answer every time it is asked a given question — and doesn’t rely onthe transformer architecturethat defines models from most contemporary AI labs. Fundamental calls it a foundation model because it goes through the normal steps of pre-training and fine-tuning, but the result is something profoundly different from what a client would get when partnering with OpenAI or Anthropic.\n\nThose differences are important because Fundamental is chasing a use-case where contemporary AI models often falter. Because Transformer-based AI models can only process data that’s within their context window, they often have trouble reasoning over extremely ",
