      "content": "The California Department of Motor Vehicles will not suspend Tesla’s sales and manufacturing licenses for 30 days because the EV maker has stopped using the term “Autopilot” in the marketing of its vehicles in the state.\n\nThe decision,issued late Tuesday, means Tesla can continue selling its EVs in California without interruption and officially settles a case that has been dragging on for nearly three years. California is Tesla’s biggest U.S. market.\n\nIn November 2023, the DMV filed accusations that Tesla violated state law by using deceptive marketing of Autopilot, its basic advanced driver assistance system, as well as its more capable Full Self-Driving driver assistance software. The state regulator argued that the terms mislead customers and distorted the capabilities of the advanced driver assistance systems.\n\nTesla stopped using the term “Full Self-Driving Capability,” and instead used Full Self-Driving (Supervised) to more accurately describe the system and clarify that drivers were still required to monitor it. But Tesla held on to the Autopilot term, prompting the DMV to refer the case to an administrative law judge at the California Office of Administrative Hearings.\n\nIn December, the administrative law judge agreed with the DMV’s request to suspend Tesla’s sales and manufacturing licenses in the state for 30 days as a penalty for its actions. The DMV agreed with the ruling, but didn’t pounce; instead, the state regulator gave Tesla 60 days to comply.\n\n“Since then, Tesla took corrective action and has stopped using the misleading term ‘Autopilot’ in the marketing of its electric vehicles in California,” the DMV stated in a release posted on its website. “Tesla had previously modified its use of the term ‘Full Self-Driving’ to clarify that driver supervision is required. By taking this prescribed action, Tesla will avoid having its dealer and manufacturer licenses suspended in the state for 30 days by the DMV.”\n\nTesla didn’t just stop using the term Autopilot, though. In January, the companydiscontinued Autopilotin the U.S. and Canada altogether. The move not only helped it comply with the DMV but was also viewed as a way to boost adoption of FSD, which unlike Autopilot, requires the owner to pay for the upgraded system.\n\nFSD Supervised, which until February 14 required an $8,000 one-time fee, is now only available through a monthly subscription of $99. That subscription fee is expected to increase as the system becomes more capable, Tesla CEO Elon Muskhas said.",

      "content": "An internal research study at Meta dubbed “Project MYST” created in partnership with theUniversity of Chicago, found that parental supervision and controls — such as time limits and restricted access — had little impact on kids’ compulsive use of social media. The study also found that kids who experienced stressful life events were more likely to lack the ability to moderate their social media use appropriately.\n\nThis was one of the notable claims revealed during testimony at the social media addiction trial that began last week in Los Angeles County Superior Court. The plaintiff in the lawsuit is identified by her initials “KGM” or her first name, “Kaley.” She, along with her mother and others joining the case, is accusing social media companies of creating “addictive and dangerous” products that led the young users to suffer anxiety, depression, body dysmorphia, eating disorders, self-harm, suicidal ideation, and more.\n\nThe case is now one of several landmark trials that will take place this year, which accuse social media companies of harming children. The results of these lawsuits will impact these companies’ approach to their younger users and could prompt regulators to take further action.\n\nIn this case, the plaintiff sued Meta, YouTube, ByteDance (TikTok), and Snap, but the latter two companieshadsettledtheir claims before the trial’s start.\n\nIn the jury trial now underway in LA, Kaley’s lawyer, Mark Lanier, brought up an internal study at Meta, which he said found evidence that Meta knew of, yet didn’t publicize, these specific harms.\n\nIn Project MYST, which stands for the Meta and Youth Social Emotional Trends survey, Meta’s research concluded that “parental and household factors have little association with teens’ reported levels of attentiveness to their social media use.”\n\nOr, in other words, even when parents try to control their children’s social media use, either by using parental controls or even just household rules and supervision, it doesn’t impact whether or not the child will overuse social media or use it compulsively. The study was based on a survey of 1,000 teens and their parents about their social media use.\n\nThe study also noted that both parents and teens agreed on this front, saying “there is no association between either parental reports or teen reports of parental supervision, and teens’ survey measures of attentiveness or capability.”\n\nIf the study’s findings are accurate, that would mean that the use of things like the built-in parental controls in the Instagram app or the time limits on smartphones wouldn’t necessarily help teens become less inclined to overuse social media, the plaintiff’s lawyer argued. As the original complaint alleges, teens are being exploited by social media products, whose defects include algorithmic feeds designed to keep users scrolling, intermittent variable rewards that manipulate dopamine delivery, incessant notifications, deficient tools for parental controls, and more.\n\nDuring his testimony, Instagram head Adam Mosseri claimed not to be familiar with Meta’s Project MYST, even though a document seemed to indicate he had given his approval to move forward with the study.\n\n“We do a lot of research projects,” Mosseri said, after claiming he couldn’t remember anything specific about MYST beyond its name.\n\nHowever, the plaintiff’s lawyer pointed to this study as an example of why social media companies should be held accountable for their alleged harms, not the parents. He noted that Kaley’s mother, for example, had tried to stop her daughter’s social media addiction and use, even taking her phone away at times.\n\nWhat’s more, the study found that teens who had a greater number of adverse life experiences — like those dealing with alcoholic parents, harassment at school, or other issues — reported less attentiveness over their social media use. That means that kids facing trauma in their real lives were more at risk of addiction, the lawyer argued.\n\nOn the stand, Mosseri seemed to partially agree with this finding, saying, “There’s a variety of reasons this can be the case. One I’ve heard often is that people use Instagram as a way to escape from a more difficult reality.” Meta is careful not to label any sort of overuse as addiction; instead, Mosseri stated that the company uses the term “problematic use” to refer to someone “spending more time on Instagram than they feel good about.”\n\nLawyers for Meta, meanwhile, pushed the idea that the study was more narrowly focused on understanding if teens felt they were using social media too much, not whether or not they were actually addicted. They also generally aimed to put more of the responsibility on parents and the realities of life as the catalyst for kids like Kaley’s negative emotional states, not companies’ social media products.\n\nFor instance,Meta’s lawyers pointed toKaley being a child of divorced parents, with an abusive father, and facing bullying at school.\n\nHow the jury will interpret the findings of studies likeProject MYST and others, along with the testimonies from both sides, remains to be seen. Mosseri did note, however, that MYST’s findings had not been published publicly, and no warnings were ever issued to teens or parents as a result of the research.\n\nMeta has been asked for comment.",

Users could use that feature to insert digital likenesses of themselves into AI-generated videos. In a ruling filed Saturday, the court said the name was similar enough to cause user confusion, and rejected OpenAI’s argument that “Cameo” was merely descriptive, finding that “it suggests rather than describes the feature.”\n\nIn November,the court granted a temporary restraining order to Cameoand stopped OpenAI from using the word. The AI company thenrenamed the feature to “Characters”after that order.\n\n“We have spent nearly a decade building a brand that stands for talent-friendly interactions and genuine connection, and we like to say that ‘every Cameo is a commercial for the next one.” Cameo CEO Steven Galanis said in a statement.\n\n“This ruling is a critical victory not just for our company, but for the integrity of our marketplace and the thousands of creators who trust the Cameo name. We will continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property against any platform that attempts to trade on the goodwill and recognition we have worked so hard to establish,” he noted.\n\n“We disagree with the complaint’s assertion that anyone can claim exclusive ownership over the word ‘cameo,’ and we look forward to continuing to make our case,” an OpenAI spokesperson toldReutersin response to the ruling.\n\nOpenAI has been involved in several intellectual property cases in recent months. Earlier this month, the company ditched “IO” branding around its upcoming hardware products, according to court documents obtained byWIRED.

CEO Brashears, President Ramos, and VP of Product Grown-Haeberli realized the opportunity when designing a new generation of compute-hungry SpaceX satellites forced them to assess the optical transceiver market, and they saw its limitations.\n\nOptical transceivers are particularly important for data centers aimed at training and operating large deep learning models, because they allow multiple GPUs to work in concert. One established U.S. supplier, AOI,won a contractworth $4 billion to provide components for AWS data centers last year.\n\n“Someone will brag about a million GPU cluster; you have to multiply by four to five for the number of transceivers in that cluster,” Brashears explained.\n\nThe company’s goal is to manufacture a thousand units per day within the year so they can begin qualifying for bulk orders in 2027 and 2028.\n\nThe optical transceiver market is dominated by Chinese firms and suppliers, and Mesh sees an advantage in building its supply chain outside of that country. While trade restrictions haven’t impacted the market yet, the founders and their backers see themselves as getting in front of a national security dilemma.\n\n“If AI is the most important technology in several generations (which we believe to be true), to have critical parts of AI data center capex run through misaligned/competitive countries is a problem,” Thrive Partner Philip Clark wrote TechCrunch. “In the immediate term, Mesh is solving our need for better ways to do interconnect if we want to keep scaling AI.”\n\nThe challenge for Mesh, the founders say, is executing lights-out, automated manufacturing techniques, which aren’t common in U.S. industry. So much of this expertise is concentrated in China that even European equipment suppliers expect Chinese customers — one German firm’s standard intake form asks for a Chinese company registration number.\n\nBy co-locating design and production, the founders hope to realize more efficient and lower-cost components. Their current design removes one commonly used but power-hungry component, which Ramos said could reduce GPU cluster power usage by 3% to 5%, a meaningful amount as hyperscalers seek to wring as much efficiency out of their systems as possible.\n\nData centers are just the beginning of Mesh’s aspirations; the company sees optical wavelength communications as the next paradigm in communications.\n\n“The world has primarily focused on [radio frequencies] for a long time,” Brashears told TechCrunch. “We want to be at the precipice of transition from RF to photonics…we want to interconnect everything, and not just computers, but that’s where we’re starting.”",

      "content": "When we talk about the cost of AI infrastructure, the focus is usually on Nvidia and GPUs — but memory is an increasingly important part of the picture. As hyperscalers prepare to build out billions of dollars’ worth of new data centers, the price for DRAM chips has jumpedroughly 7x in the last year.\n\nAt the same time, there’s a growing discipline in orchestrating all that memory to make sure the right data gets to the right agent at the right time. The companies that master it will be able to make the same queries with fewer tokens, which can be the difference between folding and staying in business.\n\nSemiconductor analystDoug O’Laughlinhas an interesting look at the importance of memory chips on his Substack, where he talks with Val Bercovici, chief AI officer at Weka. They’re both semiconductor guys, so the focus is more on the chips than the broader architecture; the implications for AI software are pretty significant too.\n\nI was particularly struck by this passage, in which Bercovici looks at the growing complexity ofAnthropic’s prompt-caching documentation:\n\nThe tell is if we go to Anthropic’s prompt caching pricing page. It started off as a very simple page six or seven months ago, especially as Claude Code was launching — just “use caching, it’s cheaper.” Now it’s an encyclopedia of advice on exactly how many cache writes to pre-buy. You’ve got 5-minute tiers, which are very common across the industry, or 1-hour tiers — and nothing above. That’s a really important tell. Then of course you’ve got all sorts of arbitrage opportunities around the pricing for cache reads based on how many cache writes you’ve pre-purchased.\n\nThe question here is how long Claude holds your prompt in cached memory: You can pay for a 5-minute window, or pay more for an hour-long window. It’s much cheaper to draw on data that’s still in the cache, so if you manage it right, you can save an awful lot. There is a catch though: Every new bit of data you add to the query may bump something else out of the cache window.\n\nThis is complex stuff, but the upshot is simple enough: Managing memory in AI models is going to be a huge part of AI going forward. Companies that do it well are going to rise to the top.\n\nAnd there is plenty of progress to be made in this new field. Back in October, I covereda startup called Tensormeshthat was working on one layer in the stack known as cache optimization.\n\nOpportunities exist in other parts of the stack. For instance, lower down the stack, there’s the question of how data centers are using the different types of memory they have. (The interview includes a nice discussion of when DRAM chips are used instead of HBM, although it’s pretty deep in the hardware weeds.) Higher up the stack, end users are figuring out how to structure their model swarms to take advantage of the shared cache.\n\nAs companies get better at memory orchestration, they’ll use fewer tokens and inference will get cheaper. Meanwhile,models are getting more efficient at processing each token, pushing the cost down still further. As server costs drop, a lot of applications that don’t seem viable now will start to edge into profitability.",

Kana’s actually their fourth venture afterRapt(acquired by Microsoft in 2008),Krux(bought by Salesforce in 2016), and startup studiosuper{set}, which they incubated Kana in for 9 months.\n\nCalling this a “wondrous” time to be building, Chavez said there was a clear opportunity to bring their experience and today’s AI tech to bear on this class of problems. “We see a market that’s crying out for solutions that meet this moment […] We understand the space deeply, having wallowed in it arguably a little too long; having really stood in our customers’ pain,” he told TechCrunch.\n\nThe solution, as Kana pitches it, involves “loosely coupled” AI agents that can be tailored “on the fly,” integrated into legacy marketing software, and can simultaneously work on different operations. So a marketer could, for example, upload a media brief that Kana’s agents would analyze to figure out the campaign goals, search for the audience to target, and pull in data from inventory and market research to further tweak the plan. The platform bakes in autonomous campaign tracking, optimization, and reporting.\n\nAlongside agents, Kana offers synthetic data generation to augment third-party data sources for activities like market research and audience targeting. This, Chavez argued, could help companies reduce the costs of using third-party data, fill in gaps in the data, and help marketers run tests on various platforms faster and narrow down strategies.\n\nKana says this is all done while keeping humans in the loop so that marketers can approve the AI agents’ actions, give feedback, and customize what the agents do as their needs change.\n\nChavez and Vaidya emphasized the importance of the platform’s flexibility, arguing that the ability to deploy, tailor, and build new agents in real time would let marketers see results on their campaigns faster than they would with legacy systems.\n\nGoing forward, the startup sees that very flexibility to customize its platform for customers, doubling as its moat against incumbents and other startups building similar products.\n\n“We have the opportunity not to create bespoke solutions, but to highly tailor and configure these solutions to meet customers where they are. Larger companies just are never going to get there,” Chavez said.\n\n“We live in a world which allows us to explore a third option [with customers]: not build, not buy, but build with — build with in a way which is supported,” Vaidya added. “We can move with insane speed that these big companies just cannot. And that’s our advantage.”\n\nKana will use the fresh cash to expand hiring across engineering, product, and go-to-market. Mayfield managing partner Navin Chaddha is joining the company’s board.",

      "content": "The internet today has a permissions problem. As non-humans — chatbots, AI agents and automated systems — have proliferated on the web, so has the need to provide them with credentials, permissions, and identities. That’s one major reason identity and access management startups that help manage this new kind of digital workforce are raking in venture capital.\n\nNow, a 35-person Israeli-American startup called Venice is emerging from stealth with fresh cash and a plucky claim: that it’s already replacing industry stalwarts like CyberArk and Okta at Fortune 500 companies.\n\nVenice, founded just over two years ago, says it raised $20 million in Series A funding in December, led by IVP, with participation from Index Ventures, which led its earlier seed round.\n\nUnlike many of its well-funded rivals – which include Persona (raised a$200 millionSeries D last April), Veza (closed a$108 millionSeries D last May), and GitGuardian SAS (raised$50 millionlast week) – Venice is tackling both cloud-based and on-premises environments, a technical choice that has made the product harder to build but positioned it to win over the large enterprises still running legacy systems alongside modern cloud infrastructure.\n\nAt its helm sits 31-year-old Rotem Lurie, whose path to entrepreneurship pretty much ticks every box on VCs’ checklists. The daughter of two programmer parents in Israel (her mother was one of the country’s first female software engineers), Lurie spent four-and-a-half years as a lieutenant in Unit 8200, Israel’s elite intelligence corps, before joining Microsoft as a product manager working on what would become Defender for Identity.\n\nShe later became the first product hire at Axis Security, an access management startup that sold to Hewlett Packard Enterprise for $500 million in 2022. Just before that acquisition closed, Lurie left to join YL Ventures, a cybersecurity-focused venture firm.\n\nThat brief stint at YL Ventures proved particularly instructive. “Every day, I used to meet a team of three 23-year-old boys,” Lurie says straightforwardly over a Zoom call. “Most of those companies build their technology to be acquired. The entire strategy around what problem you’re solving and how you penetrate the market – it’s a completely different approach.”\n\nTo replace incumbents like CyberArk, which has long dominated the privileged access management market, Lurie realized she’d need to play a longer game. That meant building technology that’s both deep and comprehensive enough to support the complex, hybrid IT environments of most large enterprises.\n\nThe technical challenge ahead of Lurie went thus: most identity and access management teams juggle roughly 10 different tools to manage who and what has access to corporate systems. Venice’s platform consolidates that sprawl into a single system that handles privileged access across on-premises servers, SaaS applications, and cloud infrastructure for humans and non-human entities alike.\n\n“Tying everything together was what mattered to customers the most,” Lurie says. Indeed, Venice operates a SaaS subscription model, but Lurie insists it isn’t competing on price. “We reduce the cost, but it’s not because we go cheap on pricing,” she explains.\n\n“It’s because we spare all the overhead [associated with many of today’s offerings], especially the professional services” — the consultant fees and lengthy implementations that have become an almost unavoidable tax for enterprise security deployments.\n\nThe bet appears to be paying off. Lurie says Venice is now “completely replacing” legacy vendors at Fortune 500 and Fortune 1000 customers, and cutting implementation time to just a week-and-a-half, from the typical 6 months to 2 years, thanks to AI-powered automation. While she declined to name customers on the record, she told TechCrunch off the record that they include a 170-year-old, publicly traded manufacturing giant as well as a global music conglomerate.\n\nCack Wilhelm, the partner at IVP who led Venice’s Series A, says Lurie stood out. “The problem with most cybersecurity pitches is everyone’s tackling something too small to ever be material,” Wilhelm says. “When you look at the massive exits — CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks — they were doing audacious things from the beginning. Rotem is the same.”\n\nWilhelm points to the urgency created by AI agents as a key factor driving IVP’s investment thesis. “If every individual is going to have tens of agents working on their behalf, and privileged access tools were built for a static world of IT professionals, we need our identity concept to adjust to that,” Wilhelm said. “Very often, when [companies] are breached, they’re breached by people simply logging in with someone else’s credentials. You solve that with just-in-time permissions that are scoped to the individual and the moment.”\n\nThough crowded, the market seems eager for new solutions. Identity and access management spending was expected to exceed $24 billion in 2025, increasing by 13% from a year earlier, according to an industry group called Identity Management Institute.\n\nVenice’s team is split between Israel, where R&D is based, and North America, where the go-to-market team operates. Notably, nearly half of the cybersecurity company is women, a rarity in one of tech’s most stubbornly male-dominated sectors.\n\nLurie’s co-founder, Or Vaknin, serves as CTO (he’s pictured with Lurie, above). The company’s investors include Assaf Rappaport, co-founder and CEO of Wiz, and Raaz Herzberg, CMO at Wiz and Lurie’s former colleague from their days as interns at Microsoft.\n\nFor Lurie, who says she has spent much of her career as “the only woman in the room,” creating a more balanced team wasn’t a calculated act. “You can never see yourself doing something if you didn’t see someone like you doing it,” she says. “This is something that attracts other women — to feel like they can be part of it.”\n\nThe question now is whether Venice’s two-year head start and early Fortune 500 wins will be enough to fend off deep-pocketed competitors as they chase the same enterprise buyers. Can the market support multiple winners? Or, will identity management follow the path of other security categories and consolidate around one or two dominant players?",
